<h1>Jack North&rsquo;s Treasure Hunt</h1>

<h1><a name="ch_01"></a>Chapter I</h1>
<h2>A Chance for a Position</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the shops of John Fowler &amp; Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To look for a job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are in luck, for I heard this morning
that they want another striker in the lower shop at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll <i>strike</i> for the
opening at once, and my name is not Jack North if
I don&rsquo;t land it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be John Slowshanks when you do get
it, mind me!&rdquo; cried out another voice, from
an alley-way near at hand, and before Jack North or
his companion could recover from their surprise the
speaker, a tall, awkward youth of twenty, sped up
the street at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>The scene was in Bauton, a large manufacturing city
of New England. The first speaker was a workman at
the shops that had been mentioned, but beyond the
fact that he placed the youth before him in the way
of getting work, he needs no special introduction.</p>

<p>The other person was a lad of eighteen, with brown,
curly hair, blue eyes, and a round, robust figure.
His name was John North, and he was the son of a couple
in humble circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; cried the man, &ldquo;that
sneak will get in ahead of you, and then a snap of
your little finger for your chance of getting the job
at Fowler&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack North did not stop to hear his friend through.
He was very much in need of a situation, and he knew
the young man who had rushed in ahead of him as a
bitter enemy. That fact, coupled with his desire to
get work, caused him to dash up the street as fast
as he could run.</p>

<p>Naturally the appearance of the two running at such
a headlong pace aroused the attention of the passers-by,
all of whom stopped to see what it meant. Others rushed
out of their houses, offices or workshops to ascertain
the meaning of the race, until the street was lined
with excited, anxious men, women and children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it fire?&rdquo; asked an old, gray-headed
man, and another, catching only the sound of the last
word, repeated it and thus a wild alarm was quickly
spread.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack North had found that he could not overtake
his rival. He was not a fleet runner, while the other
had gotten a start of him, which he could not hope
to make up.</p>

<p>But he was too fertile in his resources to despair.
In fact he was never known to give up a contest which
he had once fairly entered. This persistence in whatever
he undertook was the secret of Jack North&rsquo;s
wonderful success amid environments which must have
discouraged less courageous hearts.</p>

<p>Still it looked to his enemy, as the latter glanced
back to see him leisurely turn into a side street
leading away from their destination, that he had nothing
further to fear from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you would be glad to give in,&rdquo;
cried out the delighted seeker of the situation at
the engine shops, and believing that he had nothing
further to fear, the awkward youth slackened his gait
to a walk.</p>

<p>Though Jack turned into the alley at a moderate pace,
as soon as he had gone a short distance, he started
again into a smart run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have farther to go,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;but Fret Offut will think I have given up,
and thus he will let me get in ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed the truth, when, at last, Jack came in
sight of the low-walled and scattering buildings belonging
to John Fowler &amp; Co., engine builders.</p>

<p>Fret Offut was nowhere in sight, as Jack entered the
dark, dingy office at the lower end of the buildings.</p>

<p>A small sized man, with mutton chop side whiskers,
engaged in overhauling a pile of musty papers, looked
up at the entrance of our hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want a job as striker, eh?&rdquo; he asked,
as Jack stated his errand. &ldquo;I believe Henshaw
does want another man. I will call him. What is your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alfret Offut, sir. It&rsquo;s me that wants
the job, and it&rsquo;s me it belongs to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Jack North&rsquo;s enemy who spoke, as he paused
on the threshold panting for breath, while glaring
at our hero with a baleful look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come you here?&rdquo; he demanded of Jack,
a second later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My feet brought me here, and with less slowness
than yours, judging by your appearance,&rdquo; replied
young North.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the second person on the scene,
the clerk had turned away to find Henshaw, and while
he was gone the rival youths stood glaring upon each
other.</p>

<p>After a short time a big, red-faced, soot-be-grimed
man appeared, saying as he reached them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Offut will come this way I will talk with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henshaw,&rdquo; said the clerk simply, returning
to his work, leaving the newcomer to attend to the
visitors as he thought best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha--ha!&rdquo; laughed young Offut, softly,
as he followed the foreman, &ldquo;where are you now,
Jack North?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Jack gave slight token of his feelings, he
was more vexed at this usurpation of his rights than
he cared to show. He lost no time in starting after
the others in the direction of the shop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going on twenty-one,&rdquo; Offut said, as they stopped
at the door, &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t a chap as
can outlift me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, Mr. Henshaw,&rdquo; said Jack,
brushing up, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s I who am after
the job and to whom it belongs. Mr. Jacobs--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your name Alfret Offut?&rdquo; interrupted
the other youth sharply in the midst of Jack&rsquo;s
speech. &ldquo;I reckon Henshaw knows who he is talking
to.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was me Mr. Jacobs recommended
the place to, and you are trying to steal it from
me,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;You are telling a likely
story, Jack North, and if you say another word I&rsquo;ll
hit you. Henshaw called for me, and it&rsquo;s me he&rsquo;s
going to give work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Henshaw, who for the first time seemed to realize
the situation, looked surprised, as he gazed from
one to the other.</p>

<p>Disliking to raise a fuss Jack remained silent at
first, but he felt bound to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was first at the office, and I claim--&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d claim the earth, as far as that
is concerned, you miserable chick of nobody!&rdquo;
broke in Offut.</p>

<p>The last was more than Jack could stand, and stepping
quickly forward, he cried: &ldquo;Stop, Fret Offut!
you have said enough. I don&rsquo;t want any quarrel
with you, but I am as good as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are yer?&rdquo; demanded the fiery Offut, whose
greatest delight seemed to be in provoking a quarrel.
&ldquo;I can lick you out of your boots, and I will
do it before I will let you get in here.&rdquo; By
this time Mr. Henshaw, a rather rough man, as slow
as he was of comprehension, was interested in the
dispute, and not averse to encouraging sport of the
kind, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, boys; fight it out. I&rsquo;ll
hire the lad that downs the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the job is as good as mine!&rdquo; cried
Fret Offut, rushing at Jack with great bluster and
no regard to fairness.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_02"></a>Chapter II</h1>
<h2>The Test of Strength</h2>

<p>If taken unawares, Jack North did not allow his enemy
to get very much the advantage of him. As the other
rushed forward, expecting to overpower him by sheer
force, he met him squarely in a hand-to-hand struggle
for the mastery.</p>

<p>Mr. Henshaw seemed delighted, and he cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Limber up, lads, limber up! A job to him that
comes out on top! Hi, there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sundry other exclamations came from the excited foreman
at every change of the situation, while several spectators,
attracted to the place by the out-cries, gathered
about the young contestants, lending their voices to
the confusing sounds of the scene.</p>

<p>While Fret Offut was taller and larger than Jack North,
he lacked the latter&rsquo;s firm-set muscles, and
what was of even greater account, his unflinching
determination to win. Our hero never knew what it was
to possess a faint heart, and that is more than half
the battle every time.</p>

<p>Thus when young Offut crowded him back against the
wall of the building, and every one present felt sure
he must be overpowered, Jack set his lips more firmly
together and renewed his resistance with redoubled
effort.</p>

<p>Then, as he struck his foot against a piece of scrap
iron and reeled backward in spite of all he could,
his friends groaned, while Fret Offut cried, exultantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, my fine cub, down you go this time! Henshaw--&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Henshaw never knew what was to be said to
him, neither did the young bully ever realize fully
just what followed.</p>

<p>Jack, concentrating all the strength he possessed,
rallied. He threw out his right foot in such a way
as to catch his antagonist behind his left knee, when
the latter suddenly found himself sinking. At the same
time the grasp on his collar tightened, while with
almost superhuman power he was flung backward. With
such force did Jack handle his adversary that he sent
him flying several yards away, where he fell in a pool
of dark, slimy water.</p>

<p>The spectators cheered heartily, while Mr. Henshaw
clapped his grimy hands and shouted at the top of
his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done, my hearty! That&rsquo;s a handsome
trick and well worth a job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fret Offut arose from his unwelcome bath, dripping
from head to foot with the nasty mess, presenting
a most unprepossessing appearance.</p>

<p>The foreman was turning back into the shop, followed
by Jack, and the crowd was rapidly dispersing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; he bawled, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t
fair. I tripped--stop, Henshaw! don&rsquo;t let my
job go to that miserable thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting no reply to his foolish speech, Offut followed
the others into the shop. His appearance being so
ridiculous he was greeted with cries of derision from
the workmen, which only made him the more angry and
belligerent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you for this, Jack
North!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if I follow you to
the end! My father always said your family was the
meanest on earth, and now I know it is so. But you
shall hear from me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these bitter words the defeated youth, who really
had no one to blame but himself for his ill-feeling,
disappeared, though it was not to be long before he
was to reappear in the stirring life of Jack North,
and bring him such troubles as he could not have foreseen.</p>

<p>It proved that Mr. Henshaw was anxious for another
workman, and after asking Jack a few questions, told
the lad he might begin his task at once.</p>

<p>The pay was small, less than five dollars a week,
but Jack did not let that cause him to refuse the
opportunity. He needed the money, for his folks were
in poor circumstances, and he went about his work with
a stout heart.</p>

<p>He quickly proved an adept workman, observing, rapid
to learn and always diligent, so much so that the
foreman took a strong liking to him.</p>

<p>Several days passed and it became evident to Jack
that if he had left one enemy outside the shop, he
had another within, who was ready to improve every
opportunity to trouble him. This was a small, thinfaced
man who worked with him, and whose name was Mires.
Besides being physically unable to carry an even end
with him, this workman was prone to shirk every part
of his work that he could, this portion falling largely
on Jack to do in addition to his own.</p>

<p>Jack paid no heed to this, however, but kept about
his work as if everything was all right, until a little
incident occurred which completely changed the aspect
of affairs.</p>

<p>Unknown to our hero, there had been a practice of
long standing among the workmen of &ldquo;testing&rdquo;
every new hand that came in, by playing what was believed
to be a smart trick upon him. The joke consisted in
sending the new hand in company with a fellow workman
to bring from a distant part of the shop a pair of
wheels, one of which was of iron and weighed over four
hundred pounds, while its mate was made of wood and
finished off to look exactly like its companion. The
workman in the secret always looked out and got hold
of the wooden wheel, which he could carry off with
ease, while his duped associate would struggle over
the other to the unbounded amusement of the lookers-on.</p>

<p>It heightened the effect by selecting a small, weak
man to help in the deception, and Henshaw, liking
this joke no less than his men, on the third day of
Jack&rsquo;s apprenticeship, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;North, you and Mires bring along them wheels
at the lower end. Don&rsquo;t be all day about it
either,&rdquo; speaking with unusual sharpness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment every one present was watching the scene,
beginning to smile as they saw Mires start with suspicious
alacrity toward the wheels. Some of the men, in order
to get as good a view as possible of the expected
exhibition, stationed themselves near at hand, having
hard work to suppress their merriment in advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Purty stout, air ye?&rdquo; asked Mires, as
he and Jack stood by the wheels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never boasted of my strength,&rdquo; replied
Jack, beginning to wonder why so much interest was
being manifested over so slight a matter. His surprise
was increased at that moment by discovering Fret Offut
among the spectators, his big mouth reaching almost
from ear to ear with an idiotic grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to see the fun!&rdquo; declared the latter,
finding that he had been seen by Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this one,&rdquo; said Mires,
stooping over the nearest wheel which was half buried
in dust and dirt.</p>

<p>Then, without any apparent effort, the small sized
workman raised the wheel to his shoulder and walked
back from the direction whence they had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see the big gawk lift his!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fret Offut, who had somehow been let into the secret.
Still ignorant of the deception being played upon
him, Jack North bent over to lift the remaining wheel.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_03"></a>Chapter III</h1>
<h2>A Long Trip Proposed</h2>

<p>Having seen Mires carry off the other wheel with comparative
ease, Jack naturally expected to lift the remaining
one without trouble.</p>

<p>His amazement may be therefore understood when, at
his first effort, he failed to move it an inch from
the floor.</p>

<p>It lay there as solid as if bound down!</p>

<p>His failure was the signal for Fret Offut to break
out into a loud laugh, which was instantly caught
up by the workmen, until the whole building rang with
the merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo; some one cried. &ldquo;See Mires
carry his. North ain&rsquo;t got the strength of a
mouse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time Mires had reached the opposite end of
the shop, and was putting down his burden to turn
and join in the outbursts over the discomfiture of
his young companion.</p>

<p>Jack had now awakened to the realization that he had
been the easy victim of a scheme to cast ridicule
upon him.</p>

<p>Mires could never have carried away this wheel. The
thought of the trick which had been played upon him
aroused all the latent energy he possessed. He did
not believe the wheel could weigh five hundred pounds,
and if it did not he would lift it, as he believed
he could.</p>

<p>Thus, with the shouts and laughter of the spectators
ringing in his ears, Jack stooped for a second attempt
to accomplish what no one else had ever been able
to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grunt for you!&rdquo; called Offut
in derision. &ldquo;Spit on your hands!&rdquo; said
a workman. Jack compressed his lips for a mighty effort,
and his hands closed on the rim of the wheel, while
he concentrated every atom of strength he had for
the herculean task.</p>

<p>The cries of the onlookers suddenly stopped as they
saw, to their amazement, the ponderous object rise
from the floor, slowly but surely, until the young
workman held it abreast of him. Not a sound broke the
deathlike stillness, save for the crunching of his
own footsteps, as Jack North walked across the shop
and dropped his burden upon the wheel Mires had placed
there.</p>

<p>A loud crash succeeded, the heavy iron wheel having
broken the imitation into kindling wood and smashed
into the floor.</p>

<p>The cries of derision were supplemented by loud calls
of admiration, which rang through and through the
old building until a perfect din prevailed.</p>

<p>Fret Offut waited to see no more, but stole away unobserved
by the stalwart iron workers, who crowded around their
victorious companion with hearty congratulations.
Jack had won the friendship of nearly all by his feat,
while Henshaw at once boasted of the act.</p>

<p>Mires, fancying that the laugh had been turned upon
him, and he was about right, allowed all of the bitterness
of his sullen nature to be turned against the young
apprentice. In his wicked heart he vowed he would
humiliate Jack in the eyes of his admirers in some
way and at some time. But no opportunity came for
him, as month after month passed.</p>

<p>Jack showed a wonderfully industrious nature, and
he never seemed idle. When not at work he was studying
some part of the ponderous machinery about him, as
if anxious to learn all there was to be known about
it. The knowledge he thus obtained was to be of inestimable
value to him in the scenes to come.</p>

<p>This trait of his pleased Henshaw, who, if a rough
man, was honest in his intentions, and he caused Jack&rsquo;s
wages to be raised to seven dollars a week. This was
done in opposition to his assistant, who had taken
a strange dislike to him. His reasons for this will
become apparent as we proceed. About that time Jack
was surprised to find that Fret Offut had found employment
in the building, though it was more as a helper than
as a regular workman, his chief task being to wheel
the scraps of iron and waste material away and to
wait upon the boss of the big steam hammer.</p>

<p>He did not offer to speak to Jack, but the latter
soon saw him holding whispered conversations with
Mires and the second boss, Furniss, when he felt certain
by their looks and motions that he was the subject
of their remarks. Once he overheard Offut tell a companion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wheel scrap iron always
and Jack North won&rsquo;t be boss, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had been at the engine works about six months,
when he accidentally learned that the company were
planning to ship one of their machines to South America,
and that they were looking about for a suitable person
to send with it, to help unload it properly and set
it up. A few days later, as he was leaving the shop
to go home, Henshaw came to him, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me put a flea in your ear, Jack. John Fowler
has got his eye on you for the one to go to South
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely any other announcement could have brought
greater joy to Jack, for he had a great desire to
travel, and this long journey would take him away
from home for many months, he felt it would be a grand
opportunity. But he knew that Furniss had been working
for the place, and he could not realize that such
good fortune was to fall to him, so he said to Henshaw:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that Furniss was sure of the chance.
I heard him say as much only yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
fig for Furniss! Old John had a long talk with me this
morning, and I told him you were just the chap for
the place, young and capable. He nodded his head and
I could see that you were as good as taken. Of course
we shall miss you, but it&rsquo;s a trip a youngster
like you can&rsquo;t afford to miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to go, Mr. Henshaw, and I thank
you for your kind words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cost nothing,&rdquo; returned the
bluff foreman, as he started homeward.</p>

<p>Jack was too happy over his prospects to mind the
baleful looks of Furniss the next day, or to hear
the jibes of Fret Offut. Could he have foreseen the
startling result he must have been bound with dismay.</p>

<p>The following Monday, when the day&rsquo;s work was
done and he was leaving the shop, Mr. Henshaw came
along, and slapping him on the shoulder, said: &ldquo;Let
me congratulate you, my lad. It is just as I said;
you are going to South America,--if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems too good to be true, Mr. Henshaw.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the blessed truth and I know it
I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling well over such
an appointment, for it is something any of us might
be glad of. But you deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The appearance of Furniss checked Jack&rsquo;s reply.
He could see the other understood that he had lost.
He had another proof of the fact before he got home
from Fret Offut, who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel mighty stuck up, don&rsquo;t yer? But
let me tell yer,&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first time he had spoken to Jack since
he had begun work in the shops, and our hero made
no reply.</p>

<p>The following day, as he was about to leave the shop
at the close of his work, Jack was accosted by Furniss,
who asked him to assist him a moment at the big hammer.</p>

<p>Jack started at once to his help, noticing that the
building was completely deserted at the time, except
for the second boss and himself; even Henshaw, who
generally stayed until after the workmen had left,
was gone.</p>

<p>His surprise may be imagined then when he saw Fret
Offut step from behind a huge boiler as he approached.
Still he did not dream of any sinister purpose in
the minds of the two, and he was about to stoop to
lift a piece of iron at the request of Furniss, when
he discovered a bar of iron so suspended over his
head from the cross timber that a slight movement on
his part was sure to bring it down upon his head.</p>

<p>No sooner had he seen his precarious situation than
he started back, when Fret Offut flung a heavy slug
at his feet. The effect was startling, for the concussion
on the floor sent the menacing bar overhead downward
with fearful force.</p>

<p>Jack succeeded in dodging the blow so far that he
escaped the full weight of the falling iron, which
struck the floor endwise with a heavy thud. But before
he could get beyond its reach the massive bar tipped
over, falling in such way as to strike him in the
side of the head, and felling him senseless to the
floor.</p>

<p>In a moment Furniss and Offut were bending over him
with anxious looks on their grimy countenances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he killed?&rdquo; asked the younger of the
twain.</p>

<p>Jack answered the question himself by opening his
eyes, though he was still too bewildered to attempt
to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; questioned Fret Offut. &ldquo;You
know well enough. You fixed that bar so it would hit
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the boy talk!&rdquo; came from Furniss.
&ldquo;It is true. If I get the chance--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, you shan&rsquo;t get us into trouble,&rdquo;
yelled the man, in a rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; put in Offut. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
teach him a lesson he won&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we will,&rdquo; answered Furniss; and both
started forward to attack Jack.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_04"></a>Chapter IV</h1>
<h2>Just in Time</h2>

<p>Though still somewhat dazed by the blow on his head,
Jack realized that the unprincipled twain in their
desperation would stop short of no crime in order
to carry out their purpose.</p>

<p>Thus Furniss had barely laid his hand on him before
he was on his feet ready to fight for his life if
necessary.</p>

<p>Flinging aside the second boss, he turned to meet
the assault of Fret Offut, whom he caught by the collar
and flung headlong upon a pile of scrap iron and ashes
still warm from the furnace.</p>

<p>Shrieking with pain the big youth scrambled to his
feet and began to dance around as if he had a coal
of fire in the heel of his shoe.</p>

<p>Furniss rallied to grapple anew with Jack, but though
a strong man he found his match. Used to hard work
all of his life, Jack&rsquo;s sinews seemed like bands
of steel and there was no breaking from his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help, Offut--quick!&rdquo; cried Furniss, as
his head was jabbed into the midst of a box of coal.
&ldquo;He--he&rsquo;ll kill me!&rdquo; spluttered the
discomfited man.</p>

<p>But Fret Offut failed for good reasons to heed the
supplications of his friend.</p>

<p>The next instant Furniss managed to get a hold on
Jack which enabled him to throw him upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to South America, will you?&rdquo; cried
the exultant Furniss. &ldquo;Let that settle it,&rdquo;
and he aimed a furious blow at his victim&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>But Jack was too nimble to remain still and receive
whatever attack the other might rain upon him, and
when Furniss&rsquo; fist descended it missed its mark,
to strike plump upon the sharp edge of a bar of iron,
peeling the skin on its back from knuckle to wrist.</p>

<p>At the same time Jack turned his adversary and, clearing
him, vaulted to his feet, carrying the other backwards
by the impetuous movement and sending him headfirst
into a bucket of water.</p>

<p>Before he could rise Jack had caught him by the throat
with one hand, and he immediately began to &ldquo;churn&rdquo;
the other&rsquo;s head up and down in the black water,
while the discomfited wretch, trying in vain to break
away, exclaimed in gasps:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help--don&rsquo;t--you&rsquo;ll kill me! I--Of--ut--h-e-l-p--murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you promise to let me alone after this?&rdquo;
demanded Jack, giving his victim another plunge in
the bucket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Let me go or I&rsquo;ll tell Fowler. Oh--oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Fowler, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No--no! Let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promise it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spluttered the man as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that will be enough this time.&rdquo;
declared the triumphant Jack. &ldquo;If I could get
my hands on you, Fret Offut, I would give you a dose
of the same medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nothing!&rdquo; cried the
terrified youth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to touch
me!&rdquo; and by that time he had reached the door,
to disappear an instant later.</p>

<p>Feeling that he had nothing more to fear from his
enemies, Jack left the shop to go to his home, his
mind soon occupied with thoughts of his South American
voyage rather than with the more unpleasant memory
of his recent trouble with young Offut and Furniss.</p>

<p>Before going direct to his home to tell the news there,
Jack sought another home that he might first break
the account of his good fortune to one whose fair
countenance had been in his mind&rsquo;s eye all the
afternoon.</p>

<p>He knew the hardest part of his starting on his long
voyage would be in tearing himself away from a certain
blue-eyed damsel named Jenny Moodhead.</p>

<p>At her home he was met by the girl&rsquo;s mother,
who, in answer to his inquiries for Jenny, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane is not here, and I do not see why you
have not met her, as she said she was going to see
you as you came from the shops. I am afraid something
has happened to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without further loss of time, Jack started to retrace
the way to the engine shops, though going by a different
course from that which he had come.</p>

<p>He had got about half way there, and was passing near
an old ruined mill, which stood more than half over
the river, when he was startled by the sound of a
voice, which was too familiar for him not to recognize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare come any nearer, Fret
Offut! Stand back, or the worst will be your own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Jenny speaking, and as Jack dashed down to
the side of the old mill he discovered her at the
further extremity of the ruins defiantly facing young
Offut, who was kept from approaching any nearer to
her by a club she held in her hands, uplifted over
her head.</p>

<p>Between the two was a gulf of dark waters a dozen
feet or more in width, but spanned by a plank over
which the girl had evidently passed in reaching her
place of retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take up the plank so you can&rsquo;t
come back!&rdquo; declared young Offut. &ldquo;You
see if you do not answer me in a becoming manner I
can--&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fret Offut did not have the opportunity to finish
his sentence before a stout hand was laid on his shoulder
and he was plunged headfirst into the river. &ldquo;Get
out the best you can!&rdquo; cried Jack North.</p>

<p>He turned to the girl. &ldquo;Has he dared so much
as to lay a ringer on you, Jenny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! I am so glad to see you! No, he had
not touched me, though I don&rsquo;t know what he
might have done if you had not come. You won&rsquo;t
let him drown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would serve him about right, if I did. But
he will take care of himself. See, he is crawling
out below the mill. Come with me, Jenny, for I have
important news to tell you. I am going to South America!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To South America! Oh, Jack, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The firm want me to go, and they will pay me
well for my services. I am to look after some machinery
that is to be shipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will come back?&rdquo; questioned Jenny,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, as soon as my task is done. But now tell
me about Fret Offut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is not much to tell. He--he wanted
to be sweet on me and--and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it.
That made him angry, and he followed me to this place,
and--you saw the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t bother you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will,&rdquo; said Jenny.
&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that Jack spent a pleasant hour in the company
of the girl who was his dearest friend, and then went
home to prepare for his trip of so many thousand miles.</p>

<p>His parents already knew something about the proposed
journey, so they were not much surprised. They had
seen Mr. Fowler and talked it over with the manufacturer.
Mrs. North did what she could to get Jack&rsquo;s outfit
ready for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to leave such fellows as
Fret Offut behind,&rdquo; said Jack, to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fret Offut is a bully and a fool,&rdquo; said
Mr. North, who was a blunt-spoken man. &ldquo;He will
never get along in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had spoken without knowing the truth. He was
not to get rid of Fret Offut just yet, as we shall
soon see.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_05"></a>Chapter V</h1>
<h2>On the Island of Robinson Crusoe</h2>

<p>Ho! for South America!</p>

<p>Bravely did the good steamer <i>Standish</i>
keep on her long, and, at times, stormy voyage to
the far distant shore of Western South America. She
escaped the severest storms of the Northern Atlantic,
Grossed the equatorial line in fine shape, and stemmed
the farious wrath of Cape Horn in safety. But every
one on board felt freer and in better spirits, when
at last they entered the Pacific regions where storms
are of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>The steamer&rsquo;s destination was Valparaiso, Chili,
and the commander talked of getting into port shortly.</p>

<p>Among those looking most hopefully forward to the
termination of the voyage was our hero, who had been
sent by his employers on the responsible errand of
seeing that one of their engines was properly delivered
and put into good running order. He fondly believed
it was the great opportunity of his life.</p>

<p>He was never more surprised than he was upon finding
at the last moment that Fret Offut had been delegated
to accompany him as helper.</p>

<p>At first he could not believe it; but there the awkward
youth was, and that he was sent for that purpose was
plainly indicated by the order from John Fowler &amp;
Co.</p>

<p>To his still greater surprise, the other seemed to
have forgotten or overlooked their differences, and
he greeted Jack with all the warmth of an old friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he can afford to be friendly I can,&rdquo;
thought Jack, who was not a person to cherish long
any bitterness of feeling against another, and he
resolved to treat Fret as well as possible.</p>

<p>This, coupled with that bond of sympathy for an associate
one is sure to have on leaving those dear to him far
behind, made the two seem somewhat like friends.</p>

<p>Had Jack known the truth, known the frequent and long
conversations his deceitful companion had held with
the plotting Furniss, and how the latter had worked
to get Offut sent on this voyage with him, our hero
would have felt different toward the other. The second
boss&rsquo;s parting words had been: &ldquo;Remember
you owe this opportunity to me, Fret Offut, who might
have gone but for my willingness to let you. Don&rsquo;t
forget either that if, for any reason, North does
not get to Valparaiso you will step into his place,
and gain the honor he is anxious to get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was spoken with such signs and indications as
only one in the secret could understand, and young
Offut nodded knowingly, as much as to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly, and will not fail in
my part to gain our ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may have been that the looked-for opportunity did
not come, as he had expected, or that his courage
failed him in his cowardly purpose, for no harm befel
Jack until on the evening before the day, which, if
nothing unfavorable occurred, the commander had promised
would bring them within sight of land. Jack stood
by the quarter-rail a long time watching the sun sink
into the distant water, and then the silent coming
of the stars into the firmament overhead.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening, though fleecy clouds were
beginning to fringe the horizon, and he was certain
the whole sky would be obscured soon.</p>

<p>But his mind was more engrossed with thoughts of his
parents and Jenny at home than with the calm grandeur
of a tropical sea, and he was wondering how many months
must pass before he should be able to meet her, when
the sound of a cat-like step behind him arrested his
attention.</p>

<p>Thinking of no harm, he turned slowly to greet the
one approaching, to find himself confronted by the
tall figure of Fret Offut.</p>

<p>A look of wild fierceness was on the other&rsquo;s
features, and before Jack could speak his arms were
uplifted, swinging overhead a belaying pin.</p>

<p>Reading at a glance Offut&rsquo;s horrible purpose,
Jack attempted to seize his upraised hands, but he
had barely made a move before the weapon descended
upon him!</p>

<p>With an indistinct recollection of a dull sense of
pain in his head, Jack knew no more until he was brought
back to consciousness by the feeling of water around
him and it slowly dawned upon him that he had been
sent overboard from the ship into the sea by the blow
from Fret Offut.</p>

<p>It was too dark for him to see any distance, so he
listened for some sound of the steamer.</p>

<p>Once he thought he caught the regular swish, swish
of the big wheel; but he must have been mistaken,
for after a moment he realized that the <i>Standish</i>
was not within hearing.</p>

<p>He had begun to shout for help, and this shouting
he kept up until he was hoarse, and he felt that it
would be better to save all of his strength in the
great battle for life ahead.</p>

<p>No one, who has not been there, can know the utter
hoplessness of being castaway upon the great, boundless
ocean with not even a plank to keep him from a watery
grave.</p>

<p>Jack North was brave and sanguine, but for a time
he felt that it was useless for him to try and keep
up. Then the thought of home and loved ones, with
all the bright dreams and hopes of life, gave him the
resolution to fight for victory over defeat until the
very last. He had heard of sailors who had been cast
away, and who had managed to keep afloat a whole night
and day. Might not he keep from drowning until morning?</p>

<p>At any rate he would not give up while he had the
strength to struggle against fate.</p>

<p>Buoyed up with hopes which he knew were groundless,
he swam on and on through the dark expanse of waters
girdling him.</p>

<p>When he had gone as far as he deemed prudent he would
turn upon his back and thus float upon the bosom of
the great deep, borne by its ceaseless tide he knew
not whither.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was being carried further and further out
to sea, or it might be he was slowly approaching the
shore of the southern continent.</p>

<p>That was the longest, most gloomy night Jack North
ever knew. He saw nor heard nothing of the steamer
during the long hours of darkness and desolation.</p>

<p>With the first faint streak of daylight he scanned
the surrounding sea with anxious, eager gaze. But
whither he would look, north, south, east or west,
not an object broke the monotony of the view.</p>

<p>He felt that he was hopelessly lost, and he wondered
in his despair if his true fate would be known.</p>

<p>As it grew lighter he continued to watch the sea for
some welcome sight, until he saw, away on his left,
a dark rim on the horizon. Was it a cloud or--land?</p>

<p>He dared not hope it was the latter at first, but
as it grew plainer he felt a thrill of joy pass through
his worn-out frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; he cried, coming near drowning
in the exuberance of his new-found discovery.</p>

<p>Even after he had seen land it seemed he was doomed
to disappointment.</p>

<p>It did not appear that he had strength to reach it.
Still the prospect ahead served to give power to his
weary limbs and a new lease of endurance to his overworked
body.</p>

<p>As he swam nearer he saw that great pointed peaks
pierced the sky wherever he looked, while abrupt walls
of rock rose from the water&rsquo;s edge to the height
of many hundred feet.</p>

<p>These he realized could not be scaled by him, and
as he gazed on the gray, moss-covered rocks dripping
with the spray of the ocean that continually beat
against their rugged sides, hopelessness again came
near overpowering him.</p>

<p>Above the granite front of this lonely island, as
he believed it to be, he could see stupendous ridges
of reddish earth rise in countless numbers and always
running back toward the centre, with here and there
green pastures of grass, but he looked in vain for
a break in the adamantine barrier which made this
ocean-bound realm unapproachable.</p>

<p>In his despair he was nearly overjoyed to suddenly
see a boat, with two men in it, come around an angle
of the rock-bound shore.</p>

<p>He shouted as loudly as he could in his exhausted
state for help, and then gave up the battle, and sank.</p>

<p>But strong arms were near, and the boatmen, hearing
his cries, rowed rapidly to his assistance and picked
him up as he was going down for the last time.</p>

<p>When Jack recovered consciousness he found himself
lying on a rude couch, with a friendly face looking
into his and his hand held by the same person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here you are,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I
had about given up looking for you to come out of
it. You must have had a long, hard pull against the
sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are on the island of Robinson Crusoe. As
to myself, I am an American by the name of William
Pearce. Before I shall ask you even your name I shall
advise you to keep quiet and go to sleep if you can.
You are among friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was fain to follow this well-meant advice, and
a few minutes later he was sound asleep.</p>

<p>It was nearly night before he awoke, and even then
his friend would not allow him to leave his couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a dish of goat&rsquo;s milk and I will
soon have some warm oat porridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack felt stronger when he had partaken of the simple
food offered him, but he was still too weak to move
about very much, and in less than five minutes he
was again asleep.</p>

<p>He did not awake until the following morning this
time, when he found himself in pretty good condition.</p>

<p>His host being absent at the time, he had an opportunity
to examine his surroundings. He found himself in a
small hut built of the straw of wild oats, interwoven
with long, slender sticks, while the roof was treated
in the same way. Only a few rather primitive utensils
of cooking and living were to be seen, and he was
wondering what sort of a hermit he had fallen in with
when the man entered.</p>

<p>He was past middle life, with a sunburned, bearded
and honest countenance.</p>

<p>Upon seeing that Jack had awakened, his looks instantly
brightened and he spoke cheerily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you looking so well. You will be
all right in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that I am on the island where
Robinson Crusoe spent his lonely years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless it is a fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I ever get away from it I will read the
story all over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s natural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you live here alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; there are six Chilian families here
with me. But you are beating me at asking questions,
for you have learned all there is to be learned of
me, while I cannot name you from any descendant of
old Adam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without further delay Jack told his companion the
story of his adventures.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_06"></a>Chapter VI</h1>
<h2>A Terrible Mistake</h2>

<p>Jack found Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s island a pleasanter
place than he had expected. Among the ridges were
many pretty valleys which were covered with patches
of woods or grass. Everything bore a peculiar hue of
green, from the groves of myrtle, pimento and corkwood
to the grassy plots, the natural fields of oats and
even to the moss-covered rocks of the spinelike mountains.</p>

<p>The coast, as far as he could see, overhung the sea
or rose perpendicular to such a height as to make
it inaccessible, except at one place where a rent
in the wall allowed man to enter the almost sacred
domain.</p>

<p>The rude, picturesque huts of Mr. Pearce and his associates
stood in a romantic valley, where the American told
him had stood the &ldquo;castle&rdquo; of the Crusoe
inhabitant of the island, Alexander Selkirk, whose
strange story has been read the wide world over.</p>

<p>Jack had been at the island nearly a week, and he
was looking forward to an opportunity to go to the
mainland in a few days, when Mr. Pearce informed him
that something singular had transpired during the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though no vessel is in sight this morning,
I am sure some one landed here last night between
midnight and daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is anything to fear from
such a visit, providing some one has been here?&rdquo;
asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. This island was used several
years as a penal colony for Chili, but an earthquake
so upset things that the one hundred and fifty odd
prisoners escaped, and since that no one has been sent
here. But it has been the refuge of two or three outlaws
since, as if the place had a strange fascination for
them. Perhaps they think it is a safe place to flee
to after what has occurred here. I have had no trouble
with them worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think one came last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it. But I will find out before I
am much older. I will get the Chilians to go with
us and we will explore the cells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was not kept in suspense long as to Mr. Pearce&rsquo;s
meaning.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the foot of a bluff about half a mile
from the ruins of what looked like an old fort, but
which was now embedded in banks of clay and overgrown
with moss and rank weeds, he found that the whole structure
had been built of stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was done by the Chilian government in 1767,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pearce, &ldquo;and was undone by an earthquake
in 1835. This you see here nearest was the front wall
of the main rampart. But here is the greatest wonder
in the hillside. This old building--fortress, as it
might be truthfully called--was the abode of the officers
and their men who were stationed here to watch and
guard the island, while these other retreats which
are marked by those black mouths were used for an
altogether different purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce pointed, as he spoke, to numerous dark
openings in the side of the hill, there being many
completely hidden by the rank ferns hanging in festoons
at their entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in these pits, dug into the earth to
the depth of two or three hundred feet, that the Chilian
government confined their convicts, and where, if
all reports be true, they underwent tortures that made
life a living death. The earthquake tore down all
the heavy doors, as if the elements were in league
with the poor captives, every one of whom thus managed
to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in these places the fugitives who seek
this island for safety conceal themselves. We can
find some sign at the mouth if any one has entered
a cell since yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then led the way along the broken-down entrances
of the underground excavations, now occupied by bats,
toads and vermin, but where once miserable wrecks
of manhood had found a terrible punishment for their
crimes.</p>

<p>A wild goat sprang out from one of the cells and bounded
away, but no trace of a human being was found, until
at last Mr. Pearce stopped before one cell which was
reached by descending several stone steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was one of the cells for exceptionally
bad prisoners,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearce. &ldquo;It is
not as deep as some of the others, but reeks with a
cold sweat, and the air is so damp and chilly as to
make one shiver the moment he enters. Just think of
the poor wretches confined here, where no ray of sunlight
could ever reach them, and no living soul to pity them
in their hopeless despair! This does not run into
the earth more than twenty-five feet. Your eyes are
younger and sharper than mine; see if those are not
fresh footprints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied Jack, as soon as he
had made a hasty examination; &ldquo;and I am sure
they are made by an American shoe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pearce, &ldquo;that
makes it more mysterious, and it behooves us to move
with great caution. One of us had better remain on
the outside, while the other makes an exploration
of the den. Which will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go inside, if it makes no difference
to you, only I wish you would let me have one of your
pistols.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, and you can take this knife, too.
Move cautiously, for if there is an American run to
earth in there, you may count on it that he will fight
for his life. It will be different from facing one
of those Chilians, who make a good deal of noise and
but a little resistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack promised to act with caution, and taking the
weapons tended him by his companion, he boldly pushed
his way down the rough stairway leading to the dark
dungeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the signal at the least sign of danger,
and I will be there in a trice,&rdquo; were Mr. Pearce&rsquo;s
parting words. &ldquo;Meanwhile if you hear me whistle,
don&rsquo;t fail to come back as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Jack was at the foot of the descent,
and parting the damp ferns that overhung the mouth
of the cell, he was about to enter the dismal passage,
when his foot struck something that rustled.</p>

<p>Reaching down in the darkness, his hand touched a
sheet of paper or parchment, which he picked up.</p>

<p>He had hardly done this before Mr. Pearce gave a shrill
whistle, which caused Jack to return to his side,
wondering what had happened.</p>

<p>His surprise may be imagined when he saw a squad of
armed men drawn up in front of them!</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Government soldiers in search of the
fugitive,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Pearce. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
do anything rash if you value your life. Let me speak
to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short consultation then followed in Spanish, the
new-comers all the time covering the twain with their
cocked carbines.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Pearce turned to Jack, saying: &ldquo;It
is just as I thought. They are looking for an escaped
prisoner-an Englishman, or rather youth, as they tell
me. They think you are the one and demand your immediate
surrender. The best thing you can do is to give up
without resistance. I will stand by you when the time
comes for the need of my help. They won&rsquo;t believe
a word I say now. See they are getting impatient. What
answer shall I give them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack, who did not understand a word that they had
said, realized from their manner that he could expect
no mercy from the Chilians. If Mr. Pearce could not
benefit him now, how could he later? Still his only
alternative seemed to be to surrender, upon the condition
that he be given fair treatment at the hands of the
government.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this stipulation, no sooner had
he signified his intention of yielding without resistance
than he was roughly siezed and bound. Then some of
his captors dragged him back against the side of the
bluff. The leader gave a few words of command to his
followers, who obeyed by instantly bringing their
firearms to their shoulders, pointed at Jack!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great sun!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Pearce, his
face turning white as marble as he witnessed this
summary threat, &ldquo;they mean to shoot you on the
spot!&rdquo; He had barely uttered these startling
words before the leader of the squad raised his right
hand, as a signal for the marksmen to fire.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_07"></a>Chapter VII</h1>
<h2>A Plea of the Enemy</h2>

<p>Jack realized that only a desperate effort could save
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce, whose friendship he had no reason to doubt,
stood speechless and horrified at the inhuman act
of the Chilians, unable to lift a finger if it would
have saved his life.</p>

<p>Jack was standing near to the entrance of the convict
cell and as the Chilian commander raised a hand for
his men to fire, he suddenly doubled himself up like
a jack-knife, turning a complete somersault in the
direction of the underground stairway.</p>

<p>His feet had not been secured, though his hands were
fastened behind him.</p>

<p>Acting on the impulse of the moment, without any consideration
for the result other than an escape from the murderous
fire, he plunged head-first into the entrance at the
very instant the volley of bullets sped on their deadly
mission.</p>

<p>So closely timed were the two actions that the Chilians
mistook his jump for the result of their shots, and
an exclamation of satisfaction left the leader&rsquo;s
lips, while no immediate attempt was made to reach
the side of their victim. This enabled Jack to regain
his feet and to disappear into the dark mouth of the
cavern before his enemies had recovered from their
surprise.</p>

<p>Though severely shaken up by his precipitation into
this retreat, unheeding the creeping creatures under
his feet, which made a furious rush to and fro, Jack
groped his way further and further into the gloomy
place. The damp, sweaty walls covering him with a
slimy moisture. Now and then some of the loosened
earth would fall upon him, adding to the uncanny experience
of his advance.</p>

<p>He expected the Chilians would follow him, but he
hoped in some way he might escape them. He kept on
without hearing any sound of a pursuit, until he was
suddenly conscious of being confronted by some one,
while a trembling voice called out from the darkness
ahead:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! I am armed, and you come nearer at the
peril of your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was too dark for him to see any one, but he heard
a slight movement as the words were uttered, and he
instantly recalled to mind the fact that the fugitive
fleeing from the Chilians was supposed to be hiding
in this place.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as he stopped, he said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful and you have nothing to fear from
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had been glad to notice that the unknown had
used pure English in addressing him. In a moment he
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friendless American boy who has been hunted
down like a dog because--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fret Offut!&rdquo; broke in Jack recognizing
the other&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack North!&rdquo; gasped the fugitive &ldquo;You
have betrayed me, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of that. I am here on account of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was no time to question one&rsquo;s motives.
Jack knew that the other was his mortal enemy, but
just then and there he could do no better than to
forget the past. Whatever the offense he had committed
against the Chilians, Fret was scarcely in worse color
with them than himself.</p>

<p>It did not occur to honest Jack North that by delivering
up his enemy he might save his own life.</p>

<p>Though Fret had abused his confidence shamefully,
he did not have the wish to give him over to these
foreign pursuers. For aught he knew his companion
might be as guilty of crime against them as against
himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile why had the Chilians not entered the cell
in pursuit of their prisoner? Were they in fear of
him? Not so much that as they were in fear of entering
that underground retreat, teeming with superstitious
traditions.</p>

<p>In fact no Chilian could have been induced to enter
there under any provocation short of death!</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce knew this, and when he saw Jack disappear
he was confident the lad was safe for awhile.</p>

<p>It is true the leader of the party did command his
men to enter, and uttered all sorts of threats against
them, but they simply listened without moving.</p>

<p>Neither did their commander offer to lead the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce, knowing this superstitious dread of all
Chilians to enter the subterranean prisons, waited
until the leader had stopped commanding and abusing
his soldiers, when he ventured to interpose on Jack&rsquo;s
account.</p>

<p>As he was a man of consequence in the opinion of the
Chilian chief, his words soon had the desired effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody,--the person you are in pursuit of--may
have landed on the island last night, but this boy
is a friend of mine and knows no more of him you want
than I do. I vouch for his honesty, and as he has been
here over a week you can see that he is not the one
you are looking for, who you say must have come here
since sunset yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No doubt the Chilian was glad to get off so easily
in doing what he deemed was his duty, for he ordered
his men to return to their vessel without further
delay.</p>

<p>That was the last to be seen of them, but Mr. Pearce
cautiously waited until he saw the ship sailing away
from the island before he spoke to Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of that hole if the bugs have not
carried you off,&rdquo; he called out in his blunt
way. &ldquo;The Chilians have gone back to Valparaiso
to report that they could not find their man here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack and Fret Offut had come to something of an understanding,
though the latter was reluctant to meet Mr. Pearce.</p>

<p>The islander was surprised at sight of him, but Jack
hastened to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It proves the person those Chilians were so
anxious to catch is an acquaintance of mine, being
none other than one of the <i>Standish&rsquo;s</i>
passengers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend of yours, eh? Those infernal--excuse
me, I don&rsquo;t believe I will say it. Come, let&rsquo;s
go down to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Mr. Pearce was not pleased with the appearance
of young Offut he did not show it, though he told
Jack privately that it might be best for all concerned
if they should leave the island as soon as an opportunity
offered itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see another searching party may come at
any hour, and I might not be as successful with another,
particularly with two to answer for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had no desire to remain any longer than he could
help, as pleasant as he had found life with his newly-made
friend. He was anxious to get to Valparaiso before
the <i>Standish</i> should leave on her return
voyage.</p>

<p>He had another reason, too, and a most important one.</p>

<p>He handed the paper he had picked up at the entrance
to the convict cell to Mr. Pearce for him to read
if possible, for it was written in Spanish, which
he could not make out at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce read it with some difficulty, explaining
it as best he could when he had carefully studied
it for half a day.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_08"></a>Chapter VIII</h1>
<h2>The Lonely Pimento</h2>

<p>&ldquo;The writer of this strange manuscript,&rdquo;
began Mr. Pearce, &ldquo;was evidently an unlettered
person, for it is filled with so many errors as to
be difficult to get the author&rsquo;s meaning in
many places. He was also a fugitive from justice.--I
should judge, nearly all his life. He speaks of the
diamond mines of Brazil and the hoarded treasures of
the children of the sun in the same sentence. Then
he goes on to describe a wonderful island that he
discovered while hiding from pursuers under the shadows
of the Andes in Tarapaca, Peru. Let me read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I had come out of a dense growth of
corkwood to look on a big body of water hemmed in
by the mountains, when I saw some way from the shore
a small island. I noticed it particularly on account
of a solitary pimento tree standing in the centre,
with a big rock at its foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I was hard pressed by my enemies, and
seeing what I believed was a hole under the rock I
swam out to the island. I did find plenty of room to
hide in and my pursuers did not think of looking there
for me, though they made the entire circuit of the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I stayed there two days before I dared
to venture out, but it was not until I had decided
to leave the place that I made the most wonderful
discovery of my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;The island, which was made up mostly
of rocks, was fairly honey-combed with tunnels and
underground passages, little and big, every one of
which was filled with gold!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Gold lay under my feet; gold on my left
hand; gold on my right; gold overhead; gold everywhere!
I knew from certain inscriptions that I could partly
decipher that this hidden treasure was a part of the
Incas wealth in the days of Pizzaro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;At first I was so bewildered by my discovery
that I could do nothing, but finally I took as much
of it as I could carry and left the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I was, as I thought, careful to note
all of its surroundings so I could come again when
I should wish to get the rest of my hoard. I say I
did this carefully, but a year and a half later when
I came to get the rest of my treasure I could not
find it. I could not even find the island, though
I went over the ground from Titocaca to Atacama a hundred
times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I could not even find the lake!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I felt sure I should know that pimento
tree anywhere on account of its odd shape. It had
three branches leaving the trunk, one of which ran
up several feet higher than the others, a dead branch
pointing to the northward like a skeleton finger.
There was a rim of mountains around the lake, except
for a break in the range on the north.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Since I have been there the whole mystery
has been solved in my mind and I can see that the
lonely pimento with its skeleton finger is the key.
I was there during the wet--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest is missing,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearce,
&ldquo;but I have given you the substance of the illiterate
scrawl in tolerable English as far as it remains.
Looks as if the sheet had been torn apart. There is
a fortune for you if you can only find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pearce spoke somewhat lightly, but Jack could
see that he was deeply interested in the account.</p>

<p>Our hero had been cautious enough not to let Fret
Offut into the secret, knowing he could not be trusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I could find that wonderful island
which plays at hide and seek if I were to try it,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pearce. &ldquo;What do you say to going fortune
hunting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally Jack&rsquo;s sanguine nature was thoroughly
aroused and nothing could have suited him better,
and from that time they discussed the lost island
with its treasure at every opportunity they had when
Fret was not with them.</p>

<p>There was one serious drawback to their plans.</p>

<p>It might be a long time before they would have an
opportunity to leave the island where Robinson Crusoe
had spent so many lonely years. During his stay there
Jack explored every part of the island. He noticed
that the soil had every promise of great fertility,
but that even his friend had so far taken on the laziness
of the Chilians that he cultivated as little as possible.
This island had become a sort of rendezvous for the
ships rounding Cape Horn, and many of them had contributed
to its natural and animal wealth by planting orchards
and sowing grains and in leaving there many domesticated
creatures.</p>

<p>But at this season of the year it was likely to be
considerable time before a vessel should touch there,
and Jack had been on Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s island
a little over a month, before he found a chance to
go to Valparaiso.</p>

<p>He was glad for the opportunity, but disappointed
at the last moment to find that Mr. Pearce had concluded
to give up going with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much like work, Jack. You see I have fitted
in here, and if we should find that treasure it would
be of no earthly good to me as I am alone in the world.
I hope you will find it, my lad, and that it will help
you and Jenny to make a happy home. Good bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good bye,&rdquo; said Jack, as he pressed his
friend&rsquo;s hand warmly, for he had grown to like
the kindhearted gentleman.</p>

<p>Fret Offut nodded lightly to the other, as he entered
the boat which was to take them to the vessel.</p>

<p>The trip to Valparaiso was uneventful, but there Jack
met with a great disappointment.</p>

<p>The <i>Standish</i> had left for its homeward
voyage.</p>

<p>Thus Jack found himself left alone among strangers,
save for the companionship of Fret Offut, who seemed
disposed to hold aloof from him. The other had refused
to tell him the cause of his being hunted by the Chilians,
though Jack suspected that it was in some way the result
of his attack upon him. Fret had told enough in his
sleep for our hero to know that he had been arrested
for the deed, and that he had afterwards escaped.
But Jack did not feel like saying anything to Fret
about it, as long as he showed no inclination to mention
the subject.</p>

<p>Knowing that it might be several months before he
could return to his home and being short of money,
Jack at once began to look about for an opportunity
to earn a living.  Unable to find anything to do in
Valparaiso, he walked to Tocopilla, though Fret declined
to accompany him. In this town he found work as a
machinist at the princely income of four Spanish dollars
a week. But this was better than nothing and he went
to work with a hearty good will.</p>

<p>He worked in Tocopilla steadily for a month. During
the time he heard nothing from home or from Fret Offut.</p>

<p>He still kept the paper describing the mysterious
island holding its vast, hidden treasure, but he had
not felt like undertaking the long journey necessary
to search for it.</p>

<p>Seeing no prospect of advance in his position, Jack
was beginning to think of seeking his fortune elsewhere,
when his whole future life was changed into a different
groove by the appearance of a stranger at the place
where he was working.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a Peruvian, who had been an engineer
on a railroad running through the southern part of
Peru, but had left to come to Tocopilla.</p>

<p>He and Jack soon became friends, when the latter said
to him one day:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the trouble with engineering, that
you should leave to come here, where you can&rsquo;t
begin to get the pay you did there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pay was good enough, but the shooting was
better. I care more for my life than I do for a few
silver doubloons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I do not understand you. I was
not aware that shooting and engineering went together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do in the case of the St. Resa road, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, Francis. I am interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can take out that interest shortly.
The road runs through debatable ground from St. Resa
to de la Pama. Not an inch of it but what is being
hotly contested. But it isn&rsquo;t the regulars that
make the trouble, for at present the territory belongs
to Peru, though how soon she will lose it is not for
me to say. It&rsquo;s the murderous bush-raiders that
are making the trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are the bush-raiders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That question shows a lamentable ignorance.
The bush-raiders are bands of gu&eacute;rillas united to
make war upon anybody and anything that crosses their
path. They pretend to favor Chili, but they are merely
using that for a cloak, and are robbers of the worst
class, outlawed by all governments. Of course you
know that Chili and Peru are at war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, these bush-raiders, pretending to favor
Chili, are making hot times all along the St. Resa.
It is necessary to keep the road open if Peru hopes
to hold the country, and the company are doing their
best, backed by the government. They have had as many
as twenty men on in the last six months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The three men on before me were killed by the
bush-raiders, and the one before the first of them
fell off and was killed while running the gantlet
of fire set by the fiends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say the road is all in Peru?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in Southern Peru. It runs through the
nitrate regions. Bless me if I don&rsquo;t think there
is a fortune in those mines if properly worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack, if you are dissatisfied with the
money you are making here there is an opportunity
for you. You are young and full of fire, just such
a rash head as the bush-raiders like to get hold of.
The company is offering as high as twenty pistoles
a month for a man to run that engine. More for one
day than you get here in a week. But bless me, if every
pistole was a doubloon and I had as many of them as
I could carry I would not try another trip. What are
a few paltry pistoles to a man&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I would like to get that position
as engineer on the St. Resa,&rdquo; said Jack, after
a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;I can run an engine,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have only to apply for it,&rdquo; replied
the other. &ldquo;But say, Jack, if you should be
fool enough to go up to get killed on that old engine,
you had better take a fireman along with you, for
you will not be able to find a helper up that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another silence fell upon the twain, during which
Jack&rsquo;s hands were not as busy as his brains,
until finally he laid aside his work, saying in his
blunt way:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall start within a week for St. Resa, unless
in the meantime I get some sort of word from John
Fowler &amp; Company, or from my folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that the days flew by on the wings of the wind.
Eagerly Jack waited for some kind of word from his
home, but not a letter reached him, for the reason
that his folks were very poor and had many troubles
of their own, and because the manufacturing company
that had sent him to South America were in financial
difficulties.</p>

<p>Sunday passed and then Monday, and the week came to
an end. Jack had another talk with the Peruvian about
the railroad position and then slapped his hands together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a try at it, come what
may,&rdquo; he said, determinedly.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_09"></a>Chapter IX</h1>
<h2>Jack Becomes an Engineer</h2>

<p>Jack as usual, was as good as his word.</p>

<p>He stopped long enough to lay down his tools and seek
the foreman for a leave of absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to St. Resa? You will make the journey
but one way. You will never come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jack was determined, and nothing that the other
could tell him of the perils he was sure to encounter
could deter him from his purpose.</p>

<p>An hour later he turned his back on Tocopilla.</p>

<p>He was passing one of the outer gates, near the edge
of the city, when he was stopped by one of the many
beggars which invest the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a miserable pittance,&rdquo; implored
the ragged wretch, holding out a dirty hand for the
gift.</p>

<p>Something in the beggar&rsquo;s tone and manner arrested
Jack&rsquo;s attention. He had been addressed in English,
which was unusual, but there was more than the language
to attract him to the poor alms seeker.</p>

<p>Then, as he bent a closer gaze on the person, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fret Offut! can this be you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack North!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;I
did not think of seeing you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I you, most of all in this condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all I could do, Jack,&rdquo; whined
the other. &ldquo;I have had such bad luck since you
left me! But ain&rsquo;t you looking like a peacock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have managed to get a living by working hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you have; but I wouldn&rsquo;t
work at the starvation wages they offered me. Say,
where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To St. Resa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In South Peru?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you expect to do there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to apply for a situation as engineer
on a railroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! I heard a man say this morning they were
offering big pay. Let me go with you, Jack? You will
do this for old time&rsquo;s sake? I will be fireman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s first thought was to refuse the other&rsquo;s
company. He felt that Fret had already done him harm
enough, and that his presence would be a positive
injury to him. But upon second thought he became more
generous. In spite of all Fret had done against him
he could not help pitying the young fellow now in
his forlorn condition, and thus he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will promise that you will not try to
make trouble for me and that you will do the very
best you can for yourself. You mustn&rsquo;t forget,
too, that you are going where you may not come back
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fret Offut promised very solemnly to all that Jack
asked, and the couple started on their hazardous journey
into the interior of the country which was about to
become the battleground of three nations.</p>

<p>They received a warm welcome at the railroad company&rsquo;s
office as soon as the object of their call was known.
It had been a week since the last train had gone over
the route, and a big accumulation of freight wanted
to be moved. They were offered big wages and accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Fret, we&rsquo;re in for it now,&rdquo;
said Jack, as they went to the station to make their
first trip.</p>

<p>The young fireman made no reply. He was already beginning
to regret the step he had taken, though Jack&rsquo;s
fearlessness was not without its effect on him.</p>

<p>A big crowd was at the station to see the train start,
which made Fret feel the importance of his position.</p>

<p>The train had a fifty-mile run and Jack found that
he was expected to make it and return the same day.
This did not seem a difficult task, providing the
bush-raiders let them alone.</p>

<p>The road was in a terrible condition, yet the first
trip was made without adventure and Fret&rsquo;s spirits
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably the bush-raiders did not know we were
going yesterday,&rdquo; said Jack, as his helper was
boasting of their easy job.</p>

<p>Jack could not say as much when he got back from his
second trip, for no less than three shots had been
fired into the caboose.</p>

<p>Fret Offut was in genuine alarm. The situation was
worse than had been described to Jack. Reports showed
that the bush-raiders were gaining in numbers every
day, and growing more bold as they increased in strength.
The country, sparsely settled, through which the railroad
ran seemed especially fitted for their guerrilla warfare,
to say nothing of the poor state of the road-bed,
which at places actually made the passage dangerous.
Then, too, the cars and engine were cheap and simple
affairs, offering no protection from the bullets of
the enemies.</p>

<p>But Jack had no intention of giving up at this stage
of the situation, and Fret concluded to risk a third
trip.</p>

<p>The company were anxious for the train to be kept
running, but offered no protection, if it could supply
any.</p>

<p>The round trip on this day was made without any shots
being fired by the enemies, though at least twenty
bush-raiders were seen drawn up in sight of the train,
as it wound its way through one of the gloomiest spots
of the entire route.</p>

<p>One of the disreputable looking party waved a red
cloth on the muzzle of his short-barreled carbine
as they whisked past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for to-morrow,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That
looks to me like a sort of warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It proved that he was not the only one who had his
suspicions, for as he swung himself upon the engine
the following morning some one stepped from out of
the motley crowd collected about the station and thrusting
a scrap of paper into his hand instantly disappeared.</p>

<p>As soon as they were fairly on their way Jack smoothed
out the crumpled paper to read in a scrawling hand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for the bush-raiders to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheet bore no signature or date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a scare by some one,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, as he handed the missive to Fret. &ldquo;But
there can be no harm in keeping a sharp lookout,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;I suppose the trouble has got
to begin soon, and it might as well be to-day as to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fret Offut, whose stock of courage was small, turned
pale, as he read the brief message:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to keep on, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else are we hired for? We should be the
laughing stock of the country if we stopped now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this warning makes it different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit as I can see. We came up here expecting
to take our chances, and as for me it seems the bush-raiders
have been very modest in opening proceedings. It is
too late for us to turn back. I--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No--no! Stop, Jack, and I will get off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get off until I stop you
will ride into de la Pama. Now don&rsquo;t be foolish
and let that little piece of paper upset you. It was
no more than we expected. Keep a cool head and stand
to your post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be as bad as it threatens. But if
you persist in leaving you can do so when we have
made this trip. I don&rsquo;t propose to be left in
the lurch by losing my fireman at a time I cannot
afford to let him go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s quiet determination and assurance served
to quiet Fret&rsquo;s fears, so he said nothing further
about quitting his duty.</p>

<p>After leaving St. Resa, the train, which was a mixed
one, made up of two passenger coaches and a dozen
freight cars, had to stop at irregular intervals,
following which the road ran through a twenty-mile
wilderness, the most of the way rugged in the extreme.</p>

<p>It was during this part of the journey that Jack expected
trouble if anywhere, and as he approached the broken
region he kept a sharp watch on every hand.</p>

<p>Fret, though pale and trembling, kept his post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me every pound of steam possible,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t go through Whirlwind
Gap flying it will be because the old engine has lost
her cunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were now rushing along at a tremendous rate of
speed considering the condition of the track, and
the old engine rocked and lurched as if it would leave
the track at any moment. There were but a few passengers
aboard, for only those who were compelled to do so
traveled during this dangerous period.  Jack knew
there was a valuable freight behind him, to say nothing
of human lives, and he was determined to get into de
la Pama if it lay in his power.</p>

<p>Thus, with a full realization of the peril of his
situation, he was standing at his post, with one hand
on the throttle and the other on the reversing lever,
peering intently ahead, taking in every object as they
sped furiously over the rails, when he suddenly beheld
a sight which for a moment fairly took away his breath.</p>

<p>They were swiftly approaching the foot of a high bluff,
upon the top of which he had discovered a dozen of
the bush-raiders looking down upon him. But they were
not the most startling part of what he saw and heard.</p>

<p>As the train dashed madly under the rocky wall, above
its terrific thunder rang a deafening crash, and he
saw with horror a huge bowlder coming down the side
of the cliff, directly toward the engine!</p>

<p>It had been loosened from its bed by the bush-raiders,
and so well had they timed their work that it would
be impossible for the engine to get beyond its reach
before the rock should fall upon it!</p>

<p>It would be equally hazardous to try and stop the
train.</p>

<p>Fret Offut had seen the appalling sight, and with
a despairing cry, feeling that it would be death to
remain on the engine, he leaped far out over the embankment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fret!&rdquo; cried Jack, but no answer came
back to the call.</p>

<p>Jack North felt that it was all over with him, but
true to the instinct of his nature, he stood bravely
at his post.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_10"></a>Chapter X</h1>
<h2>A Narrow Escape</h2>

<p>With the wild cry of Fret Offut and the exultant yells
of the bush-raiders ringing in his ears above the
thunder of the rushing train, Jack North heard the
ominous crash, of the descending bowlder, and saw with
a dazed look its swift approach.</p>

<p>The locomotive, throbbing and panting like a human
being in a race for life, was fairly flying along
the winding track.</p>

<p>It all lasted but a moment, the downward rush of the
deadly body, the cries of exultation and despair,
the lightning-like passing of the fatal spot by the
engine, and the ordeal was over as quickly as it had
come!</p>

<p>The descent of the ponderous missile was swift and
sure until a projection on the side of the cliff was
reached, when with a terrific concussion the bowlder
glanced. It suddenly shot outward like a cannon ball,
and was carried fairly over the engine into the gulch
below.</p>

<p>Jack witnessed this miraculous movement with breathless
eagerness bordering upon terror.</p>

<p>The huge rock passed so near that it scraped the top
of the caboose, and the current of air it raised swept
the boy engineer&rsquo;s cap from his head.</p>

<p>The train had got its length beyond the place before
Jack could realize that he had escaped.</p>

<p>The bush-raiders reminded him of it then, if he needed
any further notification, by a volley of bullets and
renewed yells of rage.</p>

<p>Though some of the leaden missiles flew uncomfortably
near his head, Jack was unharmed, and as he was borne
on by the iron horse around the next curve in the
track, leaving his enemies out of sight, he offered
a prayer of thankfulness for his providential escape.</p>

<p>Fret, he was certain, must have been killed by his
mad leap from the engine. As much as he would have
liked to have gone back and looked for the youth,
he knew such a course would have been the height of
folly. Besides his own life to look after, there were
the passengers who had intrusted themselves to his
care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Fret! I could do no good now, and I must
remember the others. If you had only remained on the
engine it would have been better for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his infinite relief, Jack saw nor heard nothing
further of the baffled bush-raiders, who must have
been greatly surprised at the escape of the train
with its rich freight.</p>

<p>At the first station, which was several miles away
from the scene of the outlaws&rsquo; attack, the young
engineer told of the loss of his fireman and his own
narrow escape from death, when an armed squad of men
started to search for the body of the missing youth,
and to rout the bush-raiders if they could be found.</p>

<p>Finding an assistant at this place, Jack finished
his run to de la Pama and then came back to this station,
which was known as Resaca.</p>

<p>The relief party had not returned, but Jack was told
that a bridge had been found to be unsafe for the
passage of the train, so he could not reach St Resa
that day, while it might be a week before the road
would be in a condition to resume his regular trips.
But he was willingly allowed to start after the relief
party with the engine and one car, accompanied by
a dozen armed men.</p>

<p>They were approaching the bridge mentioned, when they
met the others coming back, bearing in their midst
the lifeless form of Fret Offut.</p>

<p>Jack immediately stopped to have the body of his associate
put on the car, when he started on the return to Resaca.</p>

<p>The untimely fate of Fret Offut impressed him with
the great uncertainty of life. It was true the other
had never been his friend, but now that was forgotten
and he felt a deep regret over the youth&rsquo;s sad
end.</p>

<p>The return to Resaca was made in safety. In fact nothing
had been seen of the raiders since the start, and
it was uncertain what might be their next move.</p>

<p>The following day Jack saw that Fret&rsquo;s body
was given burial in a little plot within sight of
the low-walled church of this clustered settlement,
he being the only mourner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I should fall in my hazardous work, I could
not expect as much as poor Fret gets in this land
of strangers. The last bond between this wild country
and home seems to be broken. Little did we think of
this, Fret, when we anticipated that South American
trip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last sad duty done for Fret Offut, and finding
that the bridge would not be repaired inside of a
week, Jack resolved to take a little outing on his
own account.</p>

<p>He still carried with him the paper so strangely found
on Robinson Crusoe island, and he was determined to
make a search for the hidden treasure which it mentioned.</p>

<p>Accordingly, mounted on a small but sure-footed and
faithful pony, with a supply of provisions, Jack set
out on his uncertain journey without telling any one
his intentions, little dreaming of the result which
was to come of his secret movement.</p>

<p>He believed the mysterious island was nearly north
of Resaca, so he shaped his course in that direction,
keeping a sharp lookout for any enemy that might be
in his pathway.</p>

<p>He was in the heart of the great dry region of South
America, a district of nearly a thousand miles in
length, where rain seldom if ever falls, and the country
is afforded sufficient moisture by the sea vapors condensed
on the Andes and sent down upon the plains and lowlands.
The desert of Atacama lay many miles to the south,
but as he progressed he often found sections of the
country without a thing growing upon the land, though
sometimes these spots were bordered by the most abundant
growth he had ever seen, even in that realm of grand
forests and magnificent flora.</p>

<p>Everywhere, save on these dark patches of waste land,
the vegetation was on the boldest scale imaginable,
the magnitude of the trees being simply beyond the
comprehension of him who had never seen them, while
some of even the largest were adorned with beautiful
flowers, making them seem like gardens of themselves.</p>

<p>On account of the density of the growth, Jack often
found it difficult to advance, and many times he was
obliged to make long detours in order to reach a certain
point.</p>

<p>Zig-zagging about, always keeping his eyes open for
bush-raiders, wild beasts, and, above all, for the
strange island, he had spent four days in the wilderness,
when he felt that it was time for him to think of
returning to civilization.</p>

<p>He had seen no sign of the looked-for body of inland
water with its treasure island, though the increasing
presence of cinchona trees told him that he was already
ascending into the region of the Peruvian Andes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is at the foot of these mountains
that the strange island exists,&rdquo; he thought,
as he paused on the summit of one of the foothills
of the snow-crowned Monarch of Mountains. &ldquo;But
there is no sign of water, and how can I expect to
find an island where there is no water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The involuntary speech brought a smile to his lips.
As he would explain his thoughts, he said aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow I got it into my head that there was
a lake in this region, and there I was to find my
treasure island. But I have been a fool to look for
either. Come, Juan,&rdquo; patting the neck of his
pony, &ldquo;let us go back while we have sense enough
to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while he spoke he lingered around the place, as
if there was some strong fascination for him. It was
a beautiful scene, made up almost entirely of forest,
but such a forest as only Peru, with its wonderful
natural wealth, can produce.</p>

<p>The trees were composed largely of rosewoods in all
their varied beauty, the giant quassia in all their
hues and tints of foliage, with a sprinkling of cinchona,
lending a happy blending of more sober coloring, while
from the lowlands was wafted to him on the gentle breeze
of that tropical clime the perfume of the tinga.</p>

<p>The finger of silence lay on the lip of Nature, even
the broad leaves of the quassia rising and falling
on the shifting breaths of air, without that peculiar
rustling sound generally belonging to the forest domain.</p>

<p>It was the most beautiful scene he had ever looked
upon, and as he allowed his gaze to slowly move around
the encircling country, he found himself looking down
upon the strangest valley or mountain pocket he had
ever beheld.</p>

<p>The singular feature of this isolated, wood-environed
retreat was its complete absence of all kinds of growth,
except for a sort of silky grass which covered its
uneven surface like a rich carpet of the deepest green
tint. Near the centre was an oval elevation of rock
and earth higher by a few feet than knobs and miniature
hills which dotted it elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was bare of vegetation, not even the silken tasia
ornamenting its sides, though a solitary tree did
rise in lonely grandeur from its utmost crest.</p>

<p>Jack uttered a low exclamation as he saw that this
tree was a pimento.</p>

<p>In a moment his mind reverted to the description given
in the strange manuscript, but a look of disappointment
succeeded his eager anticipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That
tree stood on an island--&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rustle in the undergrowth arrested his attention
at that moment, and, before he could avoid the unexpected
attack, a dark lissom body shot through the air, to
alight squarely upon his pony, that, with a snort of
terror, started madly through the growth.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_11"></a>Chapter XI</h1>
<h2>Under the Head of a Jaguar</h2>

<p>Jack was nearly unseated by the sudden dash of his
pony, and managing to retain his position he was in
imminent danger of being swept off by the branches
of the trees.</p>

<p>The deep growl of the creature at his back rang in
his ears, and he could feel the poor pony quiver in
every muscle, as the fearful claws of the brute were
buried deep into its flesh.</p>

<p>This occupied but a moment&rsquo;s time from the attack
of the wild beast to the end of the pony&rsquo;s flight,
but it was such a moment as Jack never forgot.</p>

<p>He had seen a precipice in the pathway of the terrified
animal, but not in season to stop the maddened creature
or turn it aside, though he did make a frantic effort
to do so. As if bent upon its own destruction, the
pony made a suicidal leap down the precipitous descent.</p>

<p>The frightened creature struck upon its feet, but
immediately fell over on its right side, carrying
its rider with it and pinning him under its body.</p>

<p>The savage beast had not lost its hold, and as Jack
lay there within its deadly reach he saw for the first
time that it was the most dreaded of the wild beasts
of South America, the jaguar.</p>

<p>He had barely taken a swift glance at the furious
brute before a warning growl above him broke the momentary
silence and then a second form, the mate of that beside
him, plunged down from the top of the cliff, landing
beside the first, that uttered a fierce growl at the
same time.</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s heart fairly stopped its beating, and
finding himself unable to move his right limb, he
felt that it was all over with him.</p>

<p>The pony had apparently been killed by its fall, together
with the attack of the jaguar, as it did not move
after it fell over on its side.</p>

<p>The ferocious beasts, with a succession of sharp growls
and snarls, began to feast upon the still warm carcass
of the poor horse.</p>

<p>It was fortunate, and showed Jack&rsquo;s remarkable
presence of mind as well, that at that critical moment
he remembered that old hunters had said if one feigned
death he might escape the attack of a wild beast under
ordinary circumstances, the story of Dr. Livingstone
lying under the lion&rsquo;s paw coming vividly into
his mind. But his left leg lay on top of the pony&rsquo;s
body and close to where the two jaguars were exercising
their teeth and claws on the flesh.</p>

<p>That morning before starting from Resaca he had put
on a pair of boots with stout tops as a means of protection
from the bushes and brambles he might encounter on
his long ride. But he could not hope these would protect
him long, if at all, from the attacks of the voracious
brutes.</p>

<p>Words cannot describe his feelings as he lay there
listening to the ominous growls and crunching of the
hungry animals, expecting every moment to feel their
sharp teeth in his own flesh.</p>

<p>Two or three times he felt one or the other of the
jaguars push savagely against his foot, which was
lifted and carried forward upon the pony&rsquo;s neck
in their eagerness to get at the warm meat.</p>

<p>All of that horrible scene Jack heard and felt rather
than saw, for he did not dare to open his eyes--dare
to draw a full breath.</p>

<p>After awhile he heard one of the pair move away a
short distance, and he could hear it licking its dripping
chops after its feast.</p>

<p>Its mate continued its voracious attacks upon the
carcass, the grinding of its jaws and the crackling
of the pony&rsquo;s bones making horrible sounds for
the helpless boy.</p>

<p>When this had continued for several minutes longer,
the second jaguar stopped eating and began to lick
Jack&rsquo;s boots.</p>

<p>Nothing so far had equaled the horror of that sensation.</p>

<p>It seemed to Jack that he must go mad if it continued
long!</p>

<p>After what seemed a long time to him in his intense
agony, the dull, rasping sound ceased; the jaguar
had ended its licking, but, as if loath to leave the
spot, it allowed its head to fall forward on the half
eaten body, with its nostrils lying on Jack&rsquo;s
foot. Its slow and regular breathing finally told
that it had fallen asleep after eating its dinner.</p>

<p>Jack a little later heard the cat-like steps of its
mate leaving the place, until the pitter-patter died
away in the distance.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he dared to open his eyes,
though he did not venture to move his head or hand
a particle.</p>

<p>He could see the sleeping jaguar&rsquo;s head and
that was all that was in sight of the creature, that
still remained motionless but likely to start up at
his first movement.</p>

<p>As Jack&rsquo;s gaze followed his narrow orbit of
vision he soon saw his firearm, which had slipped
from him in his ride over the precipice and fallen
near where he lay in that terrible situation.</p>

<p>He had no sooner seen the weapon than a wild desire
to get possession of it filled his mind. If he only
had that in his hands he believed he could shoot the
jaguar before it could do him harm.</p>

<p>The longer he pondered upon this the stronger became
the desire to make the attempt. Failure could not
be any worse than that awful suspense, which in all
probability must end in death.</p>

<p>Then, as he realized that the jaguar&rsquo;s mate
might return at any moment, he resolved to make the
bold venture without more delay.</p>

<p>He was first careful to make himself sure that the
brute was still asleep, when he slowly and cautiously
raised his hand enough to reach for the carbine, which
fortunately lay stock toward him.</p>

<p>Not a sound broke the deathlike stillness of the lonely
scene, save the labored breathing of the sleeping
jaguar.</p>

<p>Never allowing his gaze to leave the creature, he
continued to reach for the firearm until he felt his
hand touch the stock.</p>

<p>As complete control as he had maintained over himself
so far in the trying ordeal, at this critical moment
he so far forgot himself as to draw a long breath--a
breath of relief to think that he had something with
which to defend himself.</p>

<p>That breath was instantly answered by a terrific growl!</p>

<p>It had awakened the light-sleeping beast, which quickly
raised its head, and its whole appearance immediately
changed, as it glared furiously around.</p>

<p>It seemed to realize at once that it had been fooled
by this human creature within its clutch, and with
another growl, louder, fiercer and more startling
than any yet, it prepared to spring on its new victim.</p>

<p>But it was no quicker of action than Jack, who knew
that his life hung on prompt work. At the same time
he lifted the carbine from the ground, he cocked the
weapon. At that moment the open jaws of the aroused
jaguar were thrust into his face, and the hot breath
of the wild creature fanned his cheek. The next instant
he ran the muzzle of the firearm into the maddened
brute&rsquo;s throat and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>A dull report followed, the jaguar&rsquo;s head was
blown into fragments, and Jack knew that his life
was saved.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_12"></a>Chapter XII</h1>
<h2>Put to the Test</h2>

<p>Though he had no more to fear from this jaguar, Jack
knew that its mate was likely to return at any moment,
and as soon as he had recovered somewhat from the
effect of the ordeal through which he had passed, he
freed himself from the weight of the pony&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>He was glad to find that his limb had not received
any serious injury, though it was so paralyzed from
lying under the pressure that it was a few minutes
before he could stand alone.</p>

<p>But he lost no more time than he could avoid before
he left the place, feeling that his situation even
then was not pleasant to contemplate. He was not only
afoot in the heart of a trackless wilderness, but many
miles from the nearest point of civilization.</p>

<p>Half an hour after leaving the scene of the jaguar&rsquo;s
attack, he made a discovery which caused him no little
concern.</p>

<p>He had lost his compass.</p>

<p>Realizing the risk of returning to the fatal spot,
as well as the uncertainty of finding the lost instrument,
he kept on without it, endeavoring to pursue as direct
a course as possible.</p>

<p>In this he was unsuccessful, and two days later he
was wandering at random through the intricate labyrinths
of a Peruvian forest, nearly worn out and disheartened.</p>

<p>Hoping that his shots might be heard by some one who
would come to his rescue, he had fired all but the
last load of ammunition he had with him, and that
charge was in his carbine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well discharge that,&rdquo; he said
to himself. &ldquo;It is my last chance and I might
as well take it now as later. It is useless for me
to try to find my way out of this wilderness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his desperation he cocked the weapon, and pointing
it skyward pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Loud and long rang out the report on the deep silence
of the forest, the distant foothills taking up the
sound and flinging it back to the valleys in echoes
that repeated the detonation far and wide. As the last
sullen sound died away in the distance he leaned against
one of the trees, saying half aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well meet the worst here as anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed away, and satisfied
that his last shot had been fired in vain, Jack started
to resume his aimless wanderings, when the sound of
footsteps fell upon his ears.</p>

<p>At first he thought it might be some wild beast prowling
through the woods, but it was not long before a human
figure burst into sight.</p>

<p>There was little of beauty in the youthful stranger
who had thus unceremoniously appeared, but Jack had
never been so glad to see any one in his life.</p>

<p>At sight of his woebegone countenance the newcomer
came to a sudden halt in his impetuous advance, exclaiming
in a voice with a peculiar and characteristic nasal
twang:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consarn ye! who air yeou scrouched down there
in that way? Aair yeou the feller who has been wasting
ammunition so like a scart peon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker&rsquo;s tone was not unfriendly, and Jack
was nearly overjoyed to find that the new-comer was
not a Peruvian.</p>

<p>Springing from his seat on a fallen tree, where he
had sunk in his respair, he cried in genuine gladness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an American!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more&rsquo;n yeou air!&rdquo; replied the
other, brushing back his long blonde hair from his
forehead as he spoke, and looking straight into our
hero&rsquo;s countenance with a pair of deep blue
eyes.</p>

<p>Then, when the two had stared upon each other for
fully a minute, both burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoo neow!&rdquo; exclaimed the Yankee boy,
&ldquo;who air yeou and what air yeou doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might ask the same question of you,&rdquo;
replied Jack. &ldquo;My name is John North and I come
from Banton, Connecticut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet yeou air called Jack every time. My name
is Plummer Plucky, but I&rsquo;m called Plum for short,
though that is all they can make short about me. I
hail from <i>New</i> England too, and I&rsquo;ll
bet my dad is hoeing taters in sight of Plymouth Rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am lost in this wilderness,&rdquo; went on
Jack. &ldquo;I hope you can show me the way out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet your boots on that. I live, leastways stop,
not three hours&rsquo; tramp from here, though if
yeou had come to-morrer yeou wouldn&rsquo;t found me
here. I have been working on the estancia of Don de
Estuaray, the dirtiest, meanest, miserliest, yellowest
old Spaniard that ever drew the breath o&rsquo; this
beautiful country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently you love the Don,&rdquo; said Jack,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? Do you know what he pays me fer work
thet&rsquo;s enought to kill a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more you have. He pays me three dollars
and sixty cents a month--think of it--if you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a small fortune&rdquo; went on
Jack. He rather liked the fellow before him. &ldquo;I
suppose you&rsquo;ve got a pile saved up in the bank
out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think so? Consarn ye, yer ain&rsquo;t got no
right to think so!&rdquo; And now the other really
looked somewhat angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered
Jack, promptly. &ldquo;I was only fooling. They don&rsquo;t
pay big wages down here--I&rsquo;ve found that out--down
near the coast, where I worked at starvation wages
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, I aint jest starved,&rdquo; said the
other youth, somewhat mollified. &ldquo;I git feed
enough--leas&rsquo;-wise, I take what I want. But it
ain&rsquo;t enough money--no it ain&rsquo;t--nohow,
consarn him anyway!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had too much at stake to desire a quarrel with
his new-found acquaintance, so he hastened to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will forgive me if I have said anything
to offend. I trust we shall be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever of anger Plum had shown quickly left his
honest countenance, and frankly holding out a hand,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never pick a quarrel with any one, but I
won&rsquo;t let any one tread on my toes. I reckon
we shall be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clasp of the hands which followed cemented the
firmest friendship of Jack North&rsquo;s life, an
acquaintance which, notwithstanding its inauspicious
beginning, was destined to ripen into a heart-felt
intimacy.</p>

<p>The hand-shaking over, the twain, Plum leading the
way, started in the direction whence the latter had
come at the sound of Jack&rsquo;s carbine. On the
way toward the estancia where the former had been working,
our hero learned the complete story of his past life;
how he had left home to win a fortune and drifted
over the world until he was now employed by this Don
de Estuaray at the princely sum which had been the
crumb of argument between them a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Jack in turn told the other his story, except that
part bearing upon the island of treasure, and long
before they had reached signs of civilization they
had become fast friends.</p>

<p>So favorably impressed was Jack with the appearance
of his new-found chum that he proposed that Plum should
apply for the position of fireman on the St. Resa
railroad, a proposition which met the other boy&rsquo;s
hearty approval the moment he learned the wages he
was likely to get His first question was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do yeou s&rsquo;pose they will have me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly. It isn&rsquo;t a question of that,
but whether you have the sand to stand up in a spot
where you are likely to lose your life any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon I can stand up where you can, and if
I do lay down it will be to stay there. Give me your
hand, old feller. I like yeou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were now approaching the estancia of Don de Estuaray,
who lived in a pleasant valley several miles from
any settlement, and as they advanced Jack could not
help noticing the tall growth of a patch of vegetation
on their right hand, as they were entering the spacious
grounds.</p>

<p>To his wonder he saw cotton plants that reached far
above his head and sugar cane which stood like forest
trees. Plum Plucky, standing on his shoulders, with
Fret Offut, had he been living then and there, on his
shoulders, could not have reached the top of the lowest
plants!</p>

<p>He saw indigo plants that amazed him for their size,
and altogether it was such a sight as he had never
seen.</p>

<p>A short distance away he saw a field of oats which
reared their heads into the air to a height of more
than fifteen feet.</p>

<p>Plum Plucky seeing the look of surprise on his countenance,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess what made that stuff grow
so? I can tell you. I just brought down some of that
funny dirt found in the barren spots on the hills yonder
and put a good lot round the roots. It beats all creation
how it sends the stuff into the air. The don said
I&rsquo;d kill it all, but I knowed better, for I
had seen the wild stuff growing like fun all round
the edges of sich places. But it don&rsquo;t seem
to hitch on in the spots themselves. S&rsquo;pect it&rsquo;s
too stout there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack at once recalled the accounts he had heard of
the nitrate beds on the Peruvian hills, though he
did not dream then of the importance of this discovery
to him.</p>

<p>Our hero was anxious to get back to Resaca, knowing
that his prolonged absence might have already cost
him his situation as engineer on the railroad, and
as Plum Plucky had fully decided to go with him, they
lost no further time in starting for that place.</p>

<p>They found the railroad officials in a fever of excitement.</p>

<p>Believing that Jack had left them and finding no one
to take his place, the bush-raiders having grown bolder
in their depredations, in their despair, the managers
were offering double their previous pay for a man
who would dare to undertake the work of getting a train
through from St. Resa to de la Pama.</p>

<p>Jack felt unbounded delight upon finding that the
pay had been raised to over a hundred dollars a trip,
and without any explanation he offered himself for
the situation a second time.</p>

<p>He was gladly accepted, with no questions asked while
Plum was given the position of fireman at a salary
which caused him to look with amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
too good to last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you meet the bush-raiders,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I can take any medicine that you can,&rdquo;
was the answer, and the boy engineer realized that
he had filled Fret Offut&rsquo;s place with a companion
of altogether different make-up.</p>

<p>Somewhat to their surprise three trips were made without
any molestation from the outlaw band, when the young
couple were put to a test few would have the courage
to meet.</p>

<p>A party of Peruvian soldiers had been sent out to
protect, as far as possible, the road, but upon this
run Jack learned at a small station before coming
to the stream where the bridge had been repaired, that
this squad had been completely routed by the outlaws
of the forest, and the victorious raiders were lying
in wait for the train.</p>

<p>In this dangerous prospect every passenger left the
cars at this place, but the order came for the train
to go on if a suitable escort could be raised.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes as many armed men were waiting a
start, though, as Jack looked over the motley party,
he realized that not one of them would be worth a
fig in a fight with the bush-raiders. Worse than that,
he felt confident that the majority, if not all, were
in league with the outlaws, and when the proper time
came would openly join with them in trying to capture
the train.</p>

<p>But the station agent, blind to this fact, priding
himself upon having done his duty, pompously ordered
Jack to proceed on his way.</p>

<p>As if not to be outdone, the conductor who remained
with one brakeman, reiterated the command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so we were in for it,&rdquo; said
Jack, as he took his post at the lever. &ldquo;What
do you say, Plum, have you the grit to try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am with you, Jack, let come what may. See!
I have got on a smashing head of steam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word Jack pulled the bell-cord, and,
throwing the valves wide open, sent the train thundering
out of the station along the gleaming track into dangers
which the bravest would not have cared to anticipate.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_13"></a>Chapter XIII</h1>
<h2>Precious Moments</h2>

<p>The little crowd at the station waved their hands
and gave expression to prolonged cries, as the train
thundered away on its perilous run.</p>

<p>Soon beyond the hearing of these outcries the two
youths, standing so bravely at their posts, heard
no sound save the deep rumbling of the engine and
cars, as they sped swiftly on their way through the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fix the fire so you can leave it for a short
time if necessary, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it any time, Jack. I wasn&rsquo;t so
green firing as they thought me. Reckon my firing
Joe Staples&rsquo; old saw-mill didn&rsquo;t hurt me
any for this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you burn it down, Plum, or was it sav--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scat! you know what I mean. But do yeou begin
to see anything ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could hardly expect to so soon, for they
will be pretty sure to keep out of sight until we
are into their trap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do yeou think they will have a rock on the
track?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some obstruction. I can&rsquo;t just
imagine how they will take us this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack, what do yeou think of &rsquo;em
fellers on the train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words seemed so much like an echo of his own thoughts
that the boy engineer started with surprise at the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet yeou,&rdquo; continued Plum,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll make us more trouble than the
fellers in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plum Plucky, you just speak my mind. I was
thinking how we could best get rid of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully for yeou, Jack North! Tell me what to
do and I&rsquo;m with yeou tooth and nail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one respect we are fortunate,&rdquo; said
Jack, in a tone which showed that he had been pondering
carefully over the matter. &ldquo;The car they are
in is to the extreme rear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You intend to take the freight through if possible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what does their being in the rear
car have to do with our getting the rest through?
Looks so they air fixed to help the raiders best so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why simply--look yonder!&rdquo; said Jack,
pointing suddenly a little to their right in the distance
ahead.</p>

<p>Plum Plucky did as he was told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack, a big rock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rock? No! Look over those tree-tops; don&rsquo;t
you see that thin column of smoke rising high into
the air and as straight as a church spire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh! yes. What of it? There can&rsquo;t be
much wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a signal of the bush-raiders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train was now winding through the valley of the
Rio Tasma, and the sullen roar of the mountain stream
was beginning to be heard above the thunder of the
cars, which were rushing along at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; replied Jack, as he
continued to watch the ascending smoke, though without
neglecting his survey ahead. &ldquo;What else can it
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we have a brakeman we can count
on in case of an attack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum hesitated a moment before replying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless it is little Pedro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just my mind. See! the smoke is dying out.
Whatever message they had to make has been made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think it could be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I think. Just before that
column appeared we must have been in sight of whoever
was on that height, and they gave that as a signal
that we were coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack you are nobody&rsquo;s fool; but couldn&rsquo;t
they hear the sound of the train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not above the roar of the river if they are
on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that. But what about
little Pedro?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this: In case those chaps in the rear
car show signs of being against us we must get rid
of them as soon as possible. Do you think you can
go back to Pedro?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do so at once and return as soon as you
can, for every moment is precious now. Tell Pedro
the moment he hears the bell ring to uncouple the
rear car. Mind you, only that. He must be there ready
at all times until we have passed through the woods.
Get back as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can count on that,&rdquo; and with these
words Plum began to climb over the tender toward the
line of cars behind.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Rio Tasma was now in plain sight,
and Jack&rsquo;s whole attention was fixed upon the
new structure that spanned the rapid stream.</p>

<p>Everything seemed all right there, so he allowed the
train to rush on at unabated speed.</p>

<p>There was a wild fascination about this perilous trip
that Jack could not shake off. Every moment he expected
to run into some unknown danger, and he would not
have been surprised to find the bridge suddenly collapsing
beneath the train.</p>

<p>But nothing of the kind occurred, and the engine was
speedily across the stream.</p>

<p>He was approaching the place where he had so narrowly
escaped death from the falling bowlder, and he could
not help glancing toward the top of the cliff, as
he was carried around the curve.</p>

<p>At that moment the report of a gun rang out sharply
on the air, the sound coming from the rear of the
train.</p>

<p>Then an answering report came from the depths of the
forest ahead!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men in the car are signaling to the raiders!&rdquo;
flashed through Jack&rsquo;s mind, and, simultaneously
with the thought, he gave the bell cord a quick jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Plum has only got there,&rdquo; he thought,
as he turned his gaze upon the course ahead.</p>

<p>He knew that Plum nor Pedro could not uncouple the
car as long as they were climbing the upgrade, but
immediately beyond the bend a descent was made into
the valley.</p>

<p>He was rapidly approaching the summit, when he made
a discovery which sent a thrill of horror through
his frame.</p>

<p>Not a hundred yards ahead lay on the right hand rail
a huge bowlder!</p>

<p>That the bush-raiders had put it there to wreck the
train he had no doubt.</p>

<p>Just then the train gave a sharp lurch, and the reports
of firearms pealed above the din of the moving train.</p>

<p>Instantly the bell cord was pulled vigorously three
or four times.</p>

<p>Plum Plucky was in trouble.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_14"></a>Chapter XVI</h1>
<h2>The Attack on the Train</h2>

<p>The firing from the rear increased, but Jack had enough
to attend to without giving it a second thought.</p>

<p>Out from the depths of the forest overhanging the
track ahead had sprung a score or more of armed men.</p>

<p>Expecting the terrible collision they had planned,
they had leaped upon the track in front of the oncoming
train, flourishing their weapons and uttering wild
yells of triumph.</p>

<p>It was a moment to Jack North which meant all to him.
To stop the train was to throw it into the hands of
his enemies; to keep on was like rushing into the
very jaws of destruction. The commotion still raging
at the rear of the train, the exulting fiends in the
pathway ahead, and not less the silent but ominous
bowlder on the gleaming track foretold the end, let
him act as he might.</p>

<p>With that unerring precision of gaze which never failed
him, Jack saw that the stone lay at such a place and
in such a position that the engine would not strike
it squarely, but sidewise, as it swept around the curve.
To make it more favorable the obstruction, as has
been said, lay on the right, or outside rail.</p>

<p>Had it been on the opposite one all would have been
changed to a terrible certainty.</p>

<p>There was no cowcatcher in front, similar to those
seen on the engines in this country, but there was
a heavy iron fender in its stead, which presented
a square defense. This bar would strike the rock below
midweight, and in such an oblique manner that he believed
the barrier would be hurled from the track without
derailing the engine.</p>

<p>Jack understood that he was taking a fearful risk,
but with all these favoring circumstances it could
not be more disastrous than to stop and to fall easy
victims to the bush-raiders and their allies.</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through his mind and he resolved
to keep on at all hazards. Thus he let on all the
steam in reserve and stood grimly at his post.</p>

<p>The engine obeyed like a living creature. It gave
a mighty plunge forward and dashed upon the ponderous
barrier disputing its advance.</p>

<p>The suspense was of brief duration, but Jack&rsquo;s
thoughts flew fast and far. He realized that if the
engine failed to clear the track it would be all over
with him in a moment.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Jenny when the shock came with
a force which fairly lifted the heavy engine! A crash
and another shock threw him face downward on the floor
of the cab.</p>

<p>He felt that the crisis had been passed and the train
was still rushing on. Furious yells--yells that made
the wildwoods ring with their intonations--filed his
ears, and a volley of bullets whistled around his
head.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw the trees rushing past him at
a terrific speed.</p>

<p>A backward glance showed him some of the outlaws beside
the track, while others were scattered on both side
of the rails, where the engine had flung them in heaps.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley lay the big bowlder, which
had been dislodged and hurled into the depths.</p>

<p>The front of the engine showed the marks of its fearful
blow, and he began to realize more fully the awful
risk he had taken.</p>

<p>The firing from the rear car had ceased, and wondering
what had become of Plum Plucky, he pulled the bell
cord once.</p>

<p>A prompt response was given by two violent jerks on
the rope, when he knew that Plum was alive and on
the train.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait before he heard some
one crawling over the tender, and a moment later his
fireman dropped beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Golly, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Plum, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t
that a squeezer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; beginning
to execute a dance on the footboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Have you lost your senses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean we&rsquo;ve got the traitors as tight
as a squirrel in a box-trap. Some of &rsquo;em jumped
off and were killed, but we&rsquo;ve got the most of
&rsquo;em, and Pedro is holding &rsquo;em there fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train had slowed so the two could talk as they
continued on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Plum,&rdquo;
said Jack, ready to believe almost anything after
what he had passed through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yeou see I just played a Yankee trick
on &rsquo;em. Just as I had got back to Pedro, and
before I could tell him what to do, some of the men
come out of the car, and I see they were going to uncouple
it just as you had told me to! By that I knew some
trick was up, and before they could tell what had
struck &rsquo;em I pushed the sinners back into the
car and shut the door. No sooner had I done that than
I covered &rsquo;em with my gun and asked Pedro to
help me. In the midst of it there came that awful chuck,
when I thought for a minute we&rsquo;d all gone together.
But it was soon over, and Perdo is standing guard
over our prisoners. As I said some of &rsquo;em jumped
off, but I guess they won&rsquo;t jump ag&rsquo;in.
Do yeou s&rsquo;pose the trouble is over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first Jack could scarcely believe the other&rsquo;s
story, but he saw that his excited companion was in
earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a fearful moment, Plum, and we should
be thankful that we came out alive. I think we have
learned the raiders a lesson they won&rsquo;t forget.
It will be best to try and get your prisoners to Resaca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would not do to stop the train or even check its
speed, as the prisoners would be sure to take advantage
of the situation. Thus Jack was obliged to keep a
sharp lookout and crowd the old engine on as fast as
he could with any degree of safety.</p>

<p>No further adventure befalling them, Jack and Plum
at last had the satisfaction of reaching Resaca. Never
was there greater surprise in town than when this
train came into the station and the true situation
became known.</p>

<p>Officers were called to take charge of the prisoners
in the car, but as nothing could be proved against
them, except what Jack and Plum stated, and as their
evidence was immediately discredited, the whole party
went free, vowing vengeance against their captors.</p>

<p>Jack saw that, on account of their being foreigners,
they had really lost favor by the capture, and he
was glad to get clear so easily. After this they ran
a week without interference, not a solitary bush-raider
having been seen. Evidently the survivors had learned
a lesson not to be quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>Of course our hero and Plum received a few praises
for their success in getting the train through as
they had, but it was evident to both that they could
not get full credit for whatever they might do. In
fact it was difficult for them to get acknowledgment
for doing an ordinary duty.</p>

<p>This was due to the fact that they were foreigners
and looked upon with suspicion, no matter what they
did.</p>

<p>Jack was not therefore much surprised when one day,
as he was stepping upon his engine at St. Resa, to
have a bright-buttoned official stop him and motion
for another man to take charge of the locomotive.</p>

<p>This new arrival was a Peruvian, and the boy engineer
was not long in learning that he was willing to work
for twelve pistoles a month.  Though smarting under
this unfair treatment, Jack offered no objections as
he stepped aside. The war with Chili was assuming
more alarming proportions, and he foresaw that troublesome
times were near at hand.</p>

<p>Plum Plucky, upon finding that he was going to have
a new master, jumped down from the cab, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have my valuable services if
you turn off Jack North!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a turn in affairs the officials had not looked
for, but the boys did not stop to listen to their
protestations.</p>

<p>Later they learned that the train did not make a run
that day.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_15"></a>Chapter XV</h1>
<h2>The Treasure Island</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Plum, as soon as he joined
his friend, &ldquo;I call that about the meanest trick
I ever see played on a feller. Of course I wasn&rsquo;t
going to stay to fire for that weazen-faced son of
old Piz-arro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems too bad you should lose your job on
my account, Plum. Particularly when I am more than
half glad to lose mine, while you have made a real
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, carrots! I ain&rsquo;t any worse off than
I was before. But what are you going to do, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to speculating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speculating, Plum. I have been thinking several
days of a scheme in which I believe there is more
money than in running an engine for bush-raiders to
run down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re going to speculate
in that dirt I put round the don&rsquo;s plants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got it right the first time, Plum. I--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ginger! going to raise coffee? &rsquo;Cause
of you air I can give you a pointer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; you are on the wrong track now. But I have
no objection to telling you. Ever since I saw the
result of your experiment I have been thinking that
the stuff would sell like hot cakes in our own country,
in places where the land is worn out and needs some
such a stimulant. At any rate I am going to send home
a cargo and see what comes of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray! I see it all now. It may pay, but I
doubt it. How air you going to get the stuff there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place I have got to get possession
of the article itself, though I do not believe this
will be a very expensive undertaking. I have a few
dollars I have saved up from my wages, and I think
I can borrow some somewhere. I am going to buy one
of the nitrate tracts as soon as I can get suited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can buy a big mine for a hundred dollars,
&rsquo;cause they&rsquo;re looked on with disfavor.
But after you&rsquo;ve bought one, what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to team a cargo to the nearest port
and then charter a ship to take it home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re smart enough to be a general,
Jack North,&rdquo; and having paid him the highest
compliment that he could, according to his estimate,
Plum added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack, I want to drive the team for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall. But, as I am anxious to begin operations,
I am going to look for my first purchase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don de Estuaray is the man you want to see.
There is a big bed on his estancia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me your experiment may have opened
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may catch onto my scheme quicker than some
one who has seen nothing of what this nitrate will
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re right and I&rsquo;m
a blockhead, as usual. But go ahead and I&rsquo;ll
tag at your heels like a dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s first move was to get a couple of ponies
for himself and Plum to ride. Then the pair, with
provisions enough to last several days, set out on
their quest.</p>

<p>Taking the direction of what he believed to be the
heart of the nitrate region, Jack in a couple of days
found several beds which he felt would prove rich
fields of speculation.</p>

<p>His prime object was to find a bed which should not
be too far removed from the railroad, or at least
where its product could be the easiest teamed.</p>

<p>It was during his search one day that he got separated
from his companion, in his desire to explore a wider
stretch of country, when he quite unexpectedly found
himself in the vicinity of his adventure with the
jaguars.</p>

<p>The memory of that encounter brought back to his mind
the lonely pimento he had seen in the valley on the
opposite side of the hilly range, and the story of
the hidden treasure filled his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only find that now how it would
help me to carry on my speculations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Determined to look again on the spot, he climbed the
ascent, until for a second time he stood on the height.</p>

<p>Before he had reached this elevated position he had
heard a deep rumbling sound in the distance--a sound
which seemed like the whirl and rush of angry waters,
as if he was approaching a high cataract.</p>

<p>Ere he had gained the extreme top of the elevation,
however, this noise suddenly died away, and the calmness
of the primeval wilderness lay on the scene as he
paused on the summit to gaze into the valley.</p>

<p>Naturally his gaze had turned in that direction, and
an exclamation of astonishment left his lips, as he
saw that the valley was gone!</p>

<p>The great basin was filled with water, the high hills
and mountains forming a mighty rim with a piece of
the huge bowl broken away where the gap existed in
the elevated range on the north. But another feature
of this inland lake had greater interest for him.</p>

<p>Near its centre was a small, barren island, entirely
destitute of growth except for a solitary tree standing
on its highest point.</p>

<p>The lonely monarch stood stark and stern in all its
solitude, with one branch lifted like a skeleton arm
pointing toward the north.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pimento--the treasure island!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>The longer he looked upon the little island and its
surroundings the more fully convinced he became that
it was the spot described in the paper he had found
so singularly on Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s island.</p>

<p>When he had recovered somewhat from his glad surprise
he urged the pony down the rough descent until the
shore of the lake was reached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Don!&rdquo; he said to the faithful pony,
&ldquo;you must take me to the island,&rdquo; never
dreaming of the effort it would cost.</p>

<p>As he spoke a commotion began in the water at the
north end, though that in front of him was still as
unruffled as ever. But the pony had barely plunged
into the tide before a deep, guttural sound came up
from the depths and long lines of foam appeared on
the surface.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted by this, Jack continued to urge the
animal ahead in spite of its desire to turn back,
until they were about midway between the bank which
they had left and the island.</p>

<p>The strange noise had increased so that now it completely
filled Jack&rsquo;s ears, while the water was in a
fearful state of agitation. It had taken on a peculiar
greenish hue, with big flecks of white foam, and here
and there were fountains spouting up bright yellow
liquid, which rose to the height of from ten to twenty
feet.</p>

<p>The youth felt a strong undercurrent, and, finding
that he could not reach the island, he tried to get
back to the shore he had left.</p>

<p>By this time the pony was struggling helplessly in
the mysterious power sucking it downward.</p>

<p>Then, before Jack could clear his feet from the stirrups,
so as to look out for himself, he was drawn under
the seething waters with his horse!</p>

<h1><a name="ch_16"></a>Chapter XVI</h1>
<h2>At the Boiling Lake</h2>

<p>As Jack felt the swirling waters closing over him,
he made greater effort to keep on the surface.</p>

<p>His gallant pony was struggling furiously for the
same purpose, but the power pulling them down was
irresistible.</p>

<p>A continual roaring filled his ears, and it seemed
as if he was being drawn into some infernal region.</p>

<p>In spite of all he could do he was carried downward,
until suddenly he felt a terrible shock, as if he
had been hurled against some stony surface, and the
next he knew he was floating on the water near the
north end of the lake, which was then quite tranquil.
He had no difficulty in swimming to the nearest point
of land.</p>

<p>Scrambling up the precipitous bank he was glad to
sink upon the ground for rest.</p>

<p>He was wondering if his pony had perished, when he
was gladdened by the sight of the animal on the opposite
side of the lake.</p>

<p>Before going to the horse Jack resolved to try to
swim out to the island, and as the water had now assumed
the calmness which had prevailed at the time he had
first seen it, he did not think of further trouble.
He had received some bruises from his recent experience,
but beyond them he felt little the worse for his adventure.</p>

<p>Removing his outer garments, so as to give greater
freedom to his movements, he stepped down to the edge
of the dark flood, which was filled with the fine
particles of earth it had swallowed.</p>

<p>As calm as the water was then, he had barely touched
it with one foot before a shriek, which rang in his
ears for a long time afterwards, rang high and far,
cut short in its midst by a fearful rush of the aroused
flood, and a column was suddenly thrown into the air
to the height of a hundred feet!</p>

<p>It was such a terrific, appalling outburst that he
hastily clambered back upon the bank, to watch the
strange sight. For fully two minutes the waterspout
quivered and vibrated in the air, when it collapsed
as abruptly as it had appeared.</p>

<p>The water of the lake continued to boil for five minutes,
when it began to subside, though bearing traces of
agitation for five minutes longer, during which Jack
watched it with intense interest.</p>

<p>Still undaunted by this marvelous display, Jack resolved
to try a third time to reach the island, selecting
a more favorable place for his descent into the water
this time.</p>

<p>As no outbreak had immediately followed his entrance
into the lake this time, he was beginning to think
that the strange phenomenon was over. But he was soon
to be undeceived.</p>

<p>All at once, without warning, a dozen columns of water
sprang upward, threatening for a moment to drain the
lake dry, and among these rushing, writhing pillars
Jack was borne into the air.</p>

<p>When the powers subsided he fell back with such a
force as to render him almost senseless. The lake
was still churned and convulsed by the mighty agency
controlling it, and he had a hard fight to reach the
shore, where he lay completely exhausted.</p>

<p>Slowly recovering his strength he finally sat up and
began to wring the water out of his clothes, deciding
to leave the place as soon as he felt able. The water
was calm then; though a short time before it had been
tossed and whipped into fury by the mysterious element
controlling it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the whole Incas treasure buried on that
island it would be safe from the hand of the despoiler,&rdquo;
he said, speaking aloud his thoughts. &ldquo;But I
do not understand it. I am willing to wager that this
is the same valley I saw when I was this way before,
though it was as dry as a palm leaf then. How calm
it is now, but I suppose if I should dare to enter
its sacred precinct it would begin again its fearful
convulsions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, Jack picked up a small stone
and tossed it into the lake. No sooner had it disappeared
beneath its dark surface than another column of water
shot upward with a sort of hissing that was terrific,
and in a moment the whole body was once more undergoing
a series of spasms frightful to behold.</p>

<p>Watching it until the outbreak was over, Jack lost
no further time in seeking the pony. Then he began
to climb the hillside leading from the place.</p>

<p>Upon the crest he paused for a last look, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is calm enough now. Sometime I will come
again, for I will know its secret if I die for it.
There is and must be a natural explanation for all
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding Plum Plucky waiting anxiously for him at the
expected place of meeting, Jack led the way toward
civilization, having come to the conclusion to close
the trade on one of the nitrate beds he had seen and
begin operations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>He said nothing to his companion of his experience
in the valley of mystery, partly because the stirring
scenes immediately following caused him to put it
in the background of his memory for a while.</p>

<p>He was the more anxious to get his first cargo of
nitrate off as the war cloud was deepening fast, and
not only was Peru and Chili at a state of bitter antagonism,
but Bolivia was threatening to mix in the trouble.
A three-cornered war, with Southern Peru for its battleground,
was anything but what he desired to see.</p>

<p>The next day he bought his first nitrate bed, paying
for it forty pistoles, which was considerably more
than he had expected, but it was large, and if his
plans only worked he believed there was a small fortune
in it.</p>

<p>He then hired oxen enough to make two six-ox teams,
with suitable wagons to draw the nitrate on, and he
engaged the services of half a dozen Peruvians to
help in the work of getting out the first loads.</p>

<p>As the bed lay remote from the few beaten paths of
the thinly populated country, it would involve considerable
hard work and time to get passable roads cut through,
so as to be able to draw loads of any size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By gosh!&rdquo; drawled Plum Plucky, as they
set out on their work, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stand
by yeou; but yeou may hang my hat on a scare-crow if
I don&rsquo;t think yeou&rsquo;ll blow yerself dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By that I suppose you mean that I shall lose
all I am putting into my venture,&rdquo; said Jack,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I mean. I&rsquo;ll bet
yeou have got about every dollar yeou have into it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have figured up that I shall have about twenty
pounds left when I have paid off my help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack! I&rsquo;d like to be there when
you get in with yer first load of dirt and see &rsquo;em
laugh. Don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose yeou have any dirt
in the teown yeou come from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not dirt that is pure nitrate of soda, and
possessing the highest qualities for fertilization
of any known compound. Hello! what is up now?&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_17"></a>Chapter XVII</h1>
<h2>In the Nitrate Fields</h2>

<p>The last exclamation was called from Jack by the fact
that the teams had suddenly stopped, and the native
drivers were shouting excitedly over something which
had happened.</p>

<p>They were at the time trying to make a roadway to
the nitrate bed through a trackless wilderness, and
had thus far progressed with greater ease than the
young speculator had calculated.</p>

<p>But upon reaching the spot where the teamsters and
workmen were holding an excited controversy, Jack
found that the cause of the excitement was the fact
that the way had been stopped by a sharp, rocky ridge,
which extended for miles in both directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go any further, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
declared the head driver. &ldquo;No team can find
its way through these rocks and up and down the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had seen this place when making his survey and
had calculated upon the difficulty in passing it,
having the route most feasible at this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let two men come forward with axes to clear
away the stunted growth, and the rest get their levers.
I will show you by to-morrow it can be passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lively work followed, the men taking hold with a vim,
so that by noon the next day a path had been cleared,
so the teams could cross the rocky ridge.</p>

<p>The balance of the distance to the mine was very favorable
and at last Jack had the satisfaction of finding himself
at his destination, when the men were set to work
loading the carts, the oxen getting a chance to rest
while it was being done.</p>

<p>While superintending the work Jack had time to realize
more fully than before the gigantic undertaking he
had upon hand. It is true the worst seemed over, now
that the path was cleared, but he knew with the rude
implements he had to work with that this had been poorly
done, and that the loaded teams would have difficult
work to reach the open country. Even then he would
be many miles from the nearest seaport, where he was
likely to meet with another obstacle in finding a
ship to transport his cargo to the United States.
Then, after he had reached home, how would he be treated?
A failure to sell his nitrate meant the loss of every
penny of money he had worked so hard to earn. But
these anxious thoughts did not rob him of his confidence
in his ultimate success. Now he had put his shoulder
to the wheel, he was not one to look back.</p>

<p>When the hour came for him to give the order to hitch
up the cattle and prepare for the return journey,
he gave his orders in a cheery tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Jack,&rdquo; said Plum, speaking
with less drawl than common, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
glad to do this. I don&rsquo;t see how you can be so
chipper, for I&rsquo;m dead sure we&rsquo;re going
to have loads of trouble before we get out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No great thing was ever done without having
more or less trouble at the outset,&rdquo; replied
Jack. &ldquo;As soon as we get started we shall find
it easier. Hi, there, Pedro!&rdquo; addressing one
of the Peruvian drivers, &ldquo;you have those oxen
yoked wrong. You ought to know better by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows best, se&ntilde;or, you or I?&rdquo; demanded
the Peruvian, showing anger at what he deemed an unwarranted
interference.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing further, feeling that he had spoken
too sharply perhaps, though he knew he was in the
right. He had found the natives anything but pleasant
men to deal with, and the quarrel of one was sure to
be taken up by his companions.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the foremost team was leaving the
nitrate bed, starting on its long journey at the slow
pace of oxen, while the other soon followed.</p>

<p>Vague reports had reached Jack before he had left
on his trip, of the uprising of the people, and of
the guerrilla warfare being carried on by the straggling
armies of the North and South. Still he did not think
he would be molested, and he felt in good spirits,
as they followed the rough pathway.</p>

<p>To be on his guard as much as possible, however, he
had thought best to keep a short distance ahead of
the teams, while Plum Plucky followed about the same
distance behind, the two thus maintaining a continual
watch over the train.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to delay their progress, until Jack
found himself climbing the steep upgrade, which the
Peruvians had declared impassable before they had
done so much work in clearing it. The course was uneven
now, and considerable of the way it was little more
than a scratch on the mountain side, with a sheer
descent on one side of hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>He had got about half way toward the top when the
loud cries of the teamsters caused him to look back.</p>

<p>A glance showed him that the foremost team was &ldquo;hung
up&rdquo; at a particularly bad place.</p>

<p>The drivers were belaboring the patient oxen unmercifully,
but not another inch could they make the animals pull
the load.</p>

<p>Shouting to the men to stop their useless goading
of the oxen, our hero ran back to the spot, finding
that the second team had stopped a short distance
below, where it was comfortably waiting for the other
to move ahead so it could resume its tedious journey.</p>

<p>As there was no chance to get the oxen on the lower
team past the upper one, so as to be hitched on to
help, on account of the narrowness of the road, Jack
quickly dismissed such an idea from his thoughts.</p>

<p>Not wishing to throw off a part of the load, which
must be lost by so doing, he stepped alongside the
cattle and began to stroke them and to speak gently
to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both teams couldn&rsquo;t pull the load up
this path, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said one of the drivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I did not think to double up at
the foot of the ascent, but it is too late to complain
now. Come, boys! all together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had taken the long, slender pole, with its ten
feet of lash, with which the drivers urged on their
patient teams, and swinging the unwieldly instrument
over their heads as he uttered the words, he hoped
to make them start.</p>

<p>The result was most unexpected.</p>

<p>Putting their shoulders to the work with renewed life,
the obedient oxen fairly touched the ground with their
bodies as they tugged ahead with their burden.</p>

<p>The cart creaked and the axles groaned, while the
heavy wheels began to revolve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray! it is mov--&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum Plucky gave expression to the exultant cry, but
he did not have time to finish before a loud snap
was heard, and the oxen were seen to suddenly plunge
up the grade, leaving the cart!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pull pin has broken!&rdquo; cried one of
the Peruvians, terrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clevis has broke--look out!&rdquo; yelled
Plum, turning pale. &ldquo;The other team will be
smashed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heavily loaded wagon, freed suddenly from the
power which had pulled it to this precarious position,
stood for a moment as if balanced on the pinacle.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had seen what was taking place with
a quicker eye than any of his companions, and as he
saw the wagon trembling in the balance for a moment
before it started on its downward course to destruction,
and realizing that a timely action could yet save
it, he rushed forward to seize hold of one of the
wheels, shouting to his assistants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick--put your shoulder to the wheel and we
may save it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum did spring forward to help his friend, but even
he was too late to be of any avail, while the Peruvians
stood idle, without offering to move.</p>

<p>While the united strength of all might have stopped
the wagon, Jack&rsquo;s resistance was futile, and
in a moment the loaded vehicle started on its downward
course, soon gaining a momentum that nothing could
stop.</p>

<p>Faster and faster it moved, the wheels creaking and
groaning unanimously, as it gained in speed.</p>

<p>The drivers of the other team in the pathway below
uttered wild cries of terror, as they saw their danger,
and began to scramble helter-skelter up the mountain
side.</p>

<p>The runaway was going directly upon them, but they
were likely to escape.</p>

<p>Not so with the oxen and wagon, which seemed surely
doomed.</p>

<p>Jack saw at a glance his whole work going to naught
in a moment&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Then his presence of mind returned to him and he thought
he saw a way to avert a part of the loss.</p>

<p>Bounding down the pathway after the runaway, he soon
managed to catch hold of the tongue, which was dodging
swiftly from one side to the other of the path, according
as it was swung to and fro by the motion of the forward
wheels.</p>

<p>Grasping this forearm with all the strength he possessed,
Jack swung it toward the near side, until locking
the forward wheel on that side against the sill of
the cart.</p>

<p>He had seen that the only chance to save the rear
wagon was at the sacrifice of the other, and no sooner
had he begun to hold the pole in that position that
the wagon began to turn toward the gulf yawning on
that side of the track.</p>

<p>It was a fearful alternative, but the best he could
do, and Jack breathed a sigh of relief as he found
the hind wheels going over the brink of the chasm.</p>

<p>For a moment the big load stood quivering on the edge
of the precipice, and then, with a crash which sounded
far up and down the rugged valley, the wagon went
headlong to its doom.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_18"></a>Chapter XVIII</h1>
<h2>An Alarm of Fire</h2>

<p>Breathless and exhausted by his almost superhuman
effort, Jack sank down upon the hard rocks, where
he had stood at the fateful moment.</p>

<p>Plum Plucky, further up the broken pathway, stood
in silent awe, while the Peruvians looked on from
their perches on the mountain side with bulging eyes
and chattering teeth.</p>

<p>The only creatures which seemed unconcerned were the
oxen which had been so narrowly threatened, as they
quietly chewed their cuds, while they blinked their
big, soft-lighted eyes.  Plum was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jiminey whack, Jack! but you&rsquo;ve done
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my only chance to save the oxen and
the other load,&rdquo; said Jack, rising to feet.
&ldquo;Better save half a loaf than to lose it all,
you know. Simply couldn&rsquo;t turn it into the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how you could think of
it. I was scart, I ain&rsquo;t ashamed to own. I&rsquo;ll
bet that other is smashed into kindling wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was already looking over the precipice after
the lost wagon, saying in a minute or so:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has come out better than I should have expected,
though it will do us no further good. It has lodged
among some trees and rocks, and I do not believe a
wheel has been broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Jack, though I reckon it don&rsquo;t
make any difference to us. But if &rsquo;em rocks
don&rsquo;t start to grow it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause the
nitrate ain&rsquo;t any good, for the stuff is sowed
all over the Andes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretty well scattered, that is a fact.
But come, boys, we must hitch on the other oxen, and
see if the double team can pull this load to the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the loss of one of his wagons and a portion
of his nitrate, which had cost him so much to get
so far, was felt keenly by Jack, he showed his indomitable
will by immediately giving his attention toward carrying
out the work of crossing the ridge.</p>

<p>The remaining load proved an easy burden for the united
teams, and in a few minutes the heavy wagon was moving
slowly up the path, the loud commands of the Peruvian
drivers echoing up and down the valley with somewhat
startling effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as we get to the summit,&rdquo; said
Jack to Plum, &ldquo;you and I will go back and see
if there is not some way to save the other wagon, even
at the sacrifice of its load.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose we might throw off what nitrate
there is left on it, and by hitching together all
the chains and ropes we have--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what is wrong now,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack, for the team had again stopped, though the wagon
was not more than its length from the summit. To the
drivers he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive up a little further, so the wagon will
stand without--&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud, angry cries stopped him in the midst of his
speech.</p>

<p>Anxious to know what had caused another interruption
in the advance, he hurried forward, to meet a most
unexpected sight.</p>

<p>Drawn up in front of the team in the narrow path was
a squad of Chilian soldiers, or bushwhackers, more
properly speaking, for he knew they did not belong
to the regular army.</p>

<p>The Peruvians were cowering by the side of the wagon
and cattle, muttering over something in their native
tongue which our hero did not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, there, soldiers!&rdquo; he called out,
in his best Spanish, &ldquo;what does this mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means if you don&rsquo;t get out of our
path, Americanos, we will hew you down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too fast, se&ntilde;or captain,&rdquo;
Jack made bold to say, &ldquo;this path is one of
my own making, though if you will allow me to get my
team to the--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitiful dog!&rdquo; cried the Chilian, &ldquo;Captain
de Costa commands you to clear his way without any
insulting words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack saw that it would be worse than useless to have
any words with this imperious Chilian, who in his
petty command felt more arrogant than a king on this
throne. Accordingly he began in a respectful tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Captain de Costa will kindly allow us to
drive to the summit we shall be able--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Americano dog! will you surrender?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the Peruvians had taken to their heels,
and Jack and Plum stood alone in front of the pompous
captain and legion.</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s first thought was to boldly refuse the
demand, knowing the other had no business to interfere
with him, and to make such a resistance as he and
his companion could. But single-handed, against such
odds, he knew it would be folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Captain de Costa, we two are
but peaceful American boys, both of us engaged--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you surrender?&rdquo; thundered the Chilian,
advancing with uplifted sword, as if he would carry
out his threat of hewing him down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are offering no resistance to you, se&ntilde;or
captain. If you will allow us to--&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a motion from the Chilian leader his soldiers leaped
forward, and Jack and Plum were quickly made prisoners.</p>

<p>The order was then given for the lads to be intrusted
to a portion of troops under the command of a sergeant,
and then the march down the pathway toward the nearest
town was begun.</p>

<p>The last Jack saw of his team it was still standing
just over the brow of the height, the patient oxen
chewing their cuds as unconcerned as if the fortunes
and the lives of their owners were not in the least
endangered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is going to be the end of this?&rdquo;
asked Plum, as they were marched along side by side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to tell. I do not think it
will be best for us to have much to say to each other
if we wish to keep together. We must keep our eyes
open for a chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum taking the hint, the friends walked along in
silence until the journey seemed without end.</p>

<p>The soldiers kept up a continual run of conversation,
Jack catching enough to know that the Chilian forces
were gaining successes wherever they met the Peruvians.
He also learned that the army of Bolivia was now their
greatest concern, and that the latter was then on a
march over the Andes to meet them.</p>

<p>At nightfall a halt was made under a spur of the mountains,
but before the sun had tipped with gold the crest
of the distant Andes the weary journey was resumed.</p>

<p>That day about noon they came in sight of a little
up-country town, which the prisoners soon learned
was known as Santa Rosilla. Its long, narrow streets
bore a deserted appearance, save for the motley-coated
soldiers passing to and fro, as if on guard.</p>

<p>The town bore every sign of a recent siege, while
the indications were as strong that the inhabitants
had been completely routed and killed or driven back
into the mountains by their conquerors.</p>

<p>Straight down the grand plaza marched the soldiers
with their captives, making their way toward the casa
consistorial, or town house, above which flapped in
the sleepy breeze the flag of Chili.</p>

<p>The door of the town house, which bore the marks of
many bullets, was off its hinges, but the rooms within
were secure enough for all prisoners of war that might
fall into their hands in that isolated district, and
thither our twain were marched.</p>

<p>To their delight, which they were careful to conceal,
they were put into a room together, though under a
strong guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks so we were in for it,&rdquo; said Plum,
after they had been left by themselves for an hour
or more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a hard set-back to my plans,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they will do with us,&rdquo;
ventured Plum, expressing the thought uppermost in
our hero&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what I have overheard I should judge we
were likely to be shot at the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears to me you&rsquo;re mighty cool
about it. Will they dare to shoot us? We are not mixed
up in their war, and it might make trouble for them
in in the end, if I know anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t stop to consider that. It
is my opinion they would dare to do anything but meet
an equal number of the enemy. It looks bad for us,
Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we can&rsquo;t dig out of here
somehow? These walls don&rsquo;t seem so awful thick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we must try and get out of this.
The first thing to do will be to free our limbs. Can
you loosen your bonds any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the next ten minutes the boys were busy trying
to free their hands from the ligatures which had been
fastened in no uncertain way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; acknowledged Plum
at last. &ldquo;I believe mine grow tighter and tighter.
Hark! I should think that soldier on guard in the hall
would get tired of that everlasting tramping back
and forth. I&rsquo;ve a mind to tell him to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not do it. I wonder if by standing on
my shoulder you could look out of that window up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking that same thing. Let&rsquo;s
try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally their attention had been attracted to a
small window, which afforded light and ventilation
for the room, but which was about ten feet from the
floor.</p>

<p>Tied hands and feet, as they were, the boys tried
many times to carry out their plan without avail,
until it must have been near midnight when Plum said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty aggravating. There must be
lights on the streets, for I&rsquo;ve seen their flash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try once more. If I lie down perhaps
you can get on my neck, after which I believe I can
raise you to the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proved a most difficult feat, but after repeated
attempts Plum succeeded in gaining the desired position,
when Jack slowly straightened up, until he had brought
his companion&rsquo;s head on a level with the window,
where by leaning against the wall he was enabled to
hold him for a hasty look over the scene without.</p>

<p>Plum had barely gained his unsteady perch before he
exclaimed in a tone of excitement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! the town is on fire! Everything is
burning up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the dull boom of a cannon reached their
ears.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_19"></a>Chapter XIX</h1>
<h2>Chilians on Both Sides</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if the old town was being raided by
some enemy,&rdquo; declared Plum, after a short pause,
during which another peal of the distant cannon awoke
far and wide the dismal night.</p>

<p>Loud cries were now heard outside the town house,
making the youths&rsquo; situation one of excitement.
In the hall adjoining their prison the steady tramp
of the sentry&rsquo;s feet had suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the fire?&rdquo; asked Jack, bracing
himself more firmly against the wall under the weight
of his companion.</p>

<p>Boom! boom! boom! rang sullenly on the scene before
Plum could reply, and then the rattle of musketry
succeeded and the hoarse shouts of men giving orders
such as no one could understand in the wild confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire lifts higher and higher,&rdquo; said
Plum, as soon as a lull in the tumult allowed him
to be heard by his companion. &ldquo;It seems to be
burning on the northeast corner of the town, and the
wind is driving it down this way like a race horse.
The plaza is full of soldiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cannonade soon became almost continual, and was
fairly deafening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will become of us?&rdquo; asked Plum,
showing his first sign of hopelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the window large enough to let us crawl
out if our hands were free?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be; but it is crossed with bars of iron
no man could break with his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your last look and then come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum took a hurried survey of the scene which he realized
he might never look upon again, but his narrow orbit
allowed of nothing more than what he had described.</p>

<p>The cannons were still thundering forth their loud-voiced
peals of war, half drowned by the incessant rattle
of the smaller arms in the hands of the town&rsquo;s
defenders.</p>

<p>In a moment Plum descended to the floor in a heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get on your feet if you can,&rdquo; said Jack
a moment later.</p>

<p>By resting against the wall, as his companion was
doing, Plum Plucky soon stood beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what we are to do in
this condition. We are sure to be killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! do you hear anything of the sentry now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he went out to join the soldiers. I see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then our way is clear. Now, Plum, I want you
to brace yourself as best you can, and when I give
the word throw all your weight against the door with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to try and break it down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old door shook and creaked beneath their combined
efforts, but it withstood the shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again--together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the whole building trembled, and the door
creaked and groaned, but still defied them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still again--together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the third attempt, nor yet the fourth nor fifth
cleared their pathway, though when both the boys were
bruised from head to feet the rusty hinges suddenly
gave away and they went headlong into the narrow hallway.</p>

<p>Jack struck upon top, and he was the first to gain
his knees, as near an erect position as he could easily
gain, and he began to crawl toward the open air, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the outer threshold they paused to take a hasty
survey of the surroundings, soon satisfying themselves
that a terrific battle was being waged at the upper
end of the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The quicker we get away the better,&rdquo;
said Jack, begining to move laboriously toward the
grand plaza, with Plum close behind him.</p>

<p>In that slow, tedious way the two crossed the yard
in front of the town house, and then steering for
the cover of a line of shrubbery bordering on the
west side of the plaza, they crawled as fast as they
could in that direction.</p>

<p>The sound of the cannon was not heard so constant
now, but the storm of the musketry had not seemed
to cease to any extent.</p>

<p>What meant infinitely more to them, the firing was
rapidly drawing nearer. The fire, too, of the burning
town was growing brighter and brighter, even the plaza
showing plainly under its vivid glare.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the shrubbery they stopped for a brief
respite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Plum, in a shrill
whisper, &ldquo;our prison is on fire! We didn&rsquo;t
get out any too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had made the same discovery. He made no reply,
his thoughts being busy in another direction.</p>

<p>An incendiary had kindled a fire at one end of the
building and so fast did the flames increase and spread
that while they watched them they sprang up and enveloped
one whole side in a crimson sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get away from this place,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;The two factions of war are coming this
way on a run. It must be the captors of the town have
met more than their match this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the escaping couple began their slow retreat,
now under cover of a dense growth reaching they knew
not how far. Nor did that matter so long as it afford
them shelter from their enemies.</p>

<p>Once, having gained a little summit from which they
could look down on the exciting scene, they stopped
to gaze back, their curiosity aroused by the wild
medley of cries.</p>

<p>The town house was now all ablaze, the lurid fire
feeding upon its walls lighting far the night scene,
while throwing a weird glamor over the contending
factions of war-crazed men, who had now both reached
the further side of the plaza and temporally suspended
hostilities.</p>

<p>There was a reason for this last, too, as explained
by Jack&rsquo;s words, as he analyzed the situation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Chilians on both sides, Plum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, Jack, that this attack on the
Chilians of the town has been made by some of their
own countrymen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; there has been some mistake made, which
has cost many needless lives. What a painful surprise
it must be to them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack afterwards learned that he had been right in
his conjectures, and that through some unexplainable
blunder one division of the Chilian army had been
sent to capture the town already in possession of another
portion.</p>

<p>Santa Rosilla was in the possession of the Chilians
sure enough now!</p>

<p>But Jack and Plum dared not stop to see the outcome
of this singular meeting between the armed forces,
but improved every moment to get away from the ill-fated
town.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_20"></a>Chapter XX</h1>
<h2>Preparations for Departure</h2>

<p>Three days later, having actually worn off the bonds
on their lower limbs by their long, painful journey
on their hands and knees through the dense growth,
until a friendly Peruvian lad finished their liberation,
Jack and Plum entered de la Pama, two sorry-looking
youths but still full of courage. Almost the first
news they learned was that the St. Resa railroad was
again without the men to run the train, which had been
stalled for weeks. In fact, the engineer and his helper
who had succeeded them, had not made one complete
trip, the fireman having blown out the boiler soon
after leaving De la Pama.</p>

<p>In this dilemma the officials hailed the appearance
of the boys with unfeigned delight. But Jack was sorry
to learn that it had been decided not to pay over
thirty pistoles a month for his services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might as well let the cars stand idle as
to pay out all we can get for help. Then, too, the
business is not going to be very good while this war
lasts, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pay was still big for that country, and Jack resolved
to accept, though before doing so he asked: &ldquo;What
will you pay my fireman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty pistoles, se&ntilde;or. That is the best we
can do. We can get plenty of men for that price.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look so. But what do you say,
Plum? That will bring you seventy-two dollars a month,
if I reckon right. I will try it for awhile if you
will go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most unexpected to them at the time they began, the
&ldquo;awhile&rdquo; proved for a year. Jack had not
dreamed he should stay so long, but his previous experience
had left him penniless, and with his fixed determination
to try again, he knew he would not be able to find
so good an opportunity to earn the needed money to
begin renewed operations. During those days Jack sent
several letters to his folks and to Jenny. In return
he received a letter from his father, stating that
all was now going fairly well with the family and
if he wanted to stay in South America he could do so.
Mr. North also sent the information that Fowler &amp;
Company had gone into the hands of a receiver and
there was no telling whether the business would be
continued or not, and Jack need not expect any back
pay from the concern.</p>

<p>From Jenny Jack heard not a word, much to his anxiety
and dismay. The fact was that Jenny&rsquo;s folks
had moved to another town and she had not received
Jack&rsquo;s letters, and consequently did not know
exactly where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has forgotten all about me,&rdquo;
he thought, with a sigh. &ldquo;Well, I suppose I
ought to go back, but I hate to do it before I&rsquo;ve
managed to get some money together. There&rsquo;s a
fortune in that nitrate and I know it, and some day
I&rsquo;ll get hold of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very much to Jack&rsquo;s surprise they were not molested
very much by the bush-raiders, whose power seemed
to have been checked by the advance of the opposing
armies, for the war was still carried on, though in
a sort of desultory manner, as if each side was afraid
of the others. Jack could foresee that the Chilians
were pretty sure to secure that portion of the country
before they got through. Plum Plucky had stood by his
friend all of this time, and they had met with some
thrilling experiences, but come out of them safely.</p>

<p>Jack saved his money like a miser, and with undimmed
faith in his ultimate success bought five more nitrate
beds, to be laughed at by his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should think you would want to look after &rsquo;em
loads you have got over on the Andes,&rdquo; Plum
would frequently say.</p>

<p>Each time Jack remained silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack,&rdquo; Plum would then invariably
say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t yeou s&rsquo;pose &rsquo;em
oxen are getting hungry by this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the other held his peace.</p>

<p>Jack had not forgotten the mysterious island in the
equally mysterious lake amid the Andes, and twice
during the year his memory had been refreshed by startling
accounts given of the place by different parties that
had visited the valley. These men had given it the
name of the &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Waters,&rdquo; not
very inappropriately.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, it now being certain that
the Peruvians were losing their hold on the province
which comprised the territory in which they were located,
Jack said to his companion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost sorry to say that I shall make
my last trip to-morrow, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going back to nitrates?&rdquo; asked the other,
showing but little surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I must get a cargo to America as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should think you would want to. Guess I will
stick to the old gal here a little longer. When I
have got enough money to get out of this swamp in
the way I want to I shall go back to old New England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you there is no place like the Old Bay
State. Yeou won&rsquo;t think me a sneak for deserting
yeou now, Jack?&rdquo; dropping back into his old-time
nasal drawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not. In fact, I think you
are doing just as I should if I were in your place.
I will speak a good word for you to get my position
as engineer. You can run the engine as well as I now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Jack. Now, how do you think of
getting that stuff to the States?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the same way I tried first, only I shall
not try to go behind that spur of the Andes, as I
did before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see my mistake now, though I believe
that is the richest deposit I have, and I shall sometime
make something out of it. I am going to get a cargo
from the bed nearest to the railroad and get the company
to freight it for me to the seaboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall see you occasionally, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I shall not be far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was as good as his word, and the following day
Plum Plucky proudly took his place as engineer, with
a new fireman to help him.</p>

<p>Jack then began to carry out his scheme of getting
a cargo of nitrate to his native land.</p>

<p>This time he obtained his supply of nitrate from a
bed less than ten miles from the railroad, drawing
it to the station with ox teams. With his better knowledge
of the country he met with success in this part of
the undertaking, and then the train carried it to
the sea-coast for him at moderate rates.</p>

<p>Before this had been done he had bargained with a
Peruvian captain of a merchantman to carry the cargo
to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>This had proved the most difficult part of his arrangements,
for with the existing war between the countries it
was sometime before he could find a man willing to
do it.</p>

<p>But he found one at last and the nitrate was eventually
loaded on the vessel.</p>

<p>It was a proud, and yet an anxious, moment for Jack
when he found everything in readiness to leave the
harbor.</p>

<p>The captain had declared his intention of setting
sail under cover of darkness, so as to escape an attack
from a Chilian ship should one offer to dispute his
passage.</p>

<p>That afternoon Jack saw Plum to bid him goodbye, feeling
sorry to part with his honest friend.</p>

<p>The latter actually cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it, Jack! I&rsquo;ve a mind to go with
you. Think of me in this heathenish country and you
among friends and rolling in wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but the wealth, Plum. But I shall be glad
to have you go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Jack, but I mustn&rsquo;t. I must
stay here long enough to get the money to pay up the
mortgage on dad&rsquo;s farm, when I shall skip by
the light of the moon. You may not find me here when
you come back, Jack, but I wish you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little after sunset the Peruvian ship moved slowly
out of the harbor of San Maceo, Jack watching the
land as it receded from sight with a peculiar interest,
and his mind ran swiftly back over the eventful time
he had passed in that faraway land.</p>

<p>He had given the captain the last pistole he possessed,
as he had been obliged to pay him in advance to get
him to undertake the task, so he was again penniless.
But he had no doubt he would have money enough as soon
as he could get home and dispose of his cargo. Over
and again he had figured out his profit, if it should
prove saleable at the moderate price he had fixed
upon it. Is it a wonder his thoughts were in a tumult?
Is it strange that he found it difficult to make himself
believe that at last after that long waiting, he was
really homeward bound?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad they will be to see me!&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;And Jenny! She will not be expecting
me. It has been so long since I left. Some of them
may be--&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his meditations by the report
of a gun in the distance, and, glancing to the port,
he discovered a ship coming up rapidly.</p>

<p>That there was something wrong in the appearance of
the stranger was evident from the bustle and excitement
which had suddenly sprung up among officers and crew,
not one of whom spoke anything but Spanish.</p>

<p>All sail had been crowded on that the ship could possibly
carry; but heavily loaded and at best a poor sailer,
the new-comer continued to overhaul them at a startling
rate.</p>

<p>Coming alongside of Jack finally, the captain said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are lost, se&ntilde;or! I ought to lose my head
for undertaking such a mad project.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be as bad as you seem to think,
se&ntilde;or capitan,&rdquo; replied Jack, hoping to encourage
the commander.</p>

<p>But all that he could say was in vain.</p>

<p>The Chilian warship, as the stranger really was, continued
to keep up its firing, though the Peruvian vessel
had not fired a gun.</p>

<p>Jack anxiously watched the approach of their pursuer,
feeling that his fortune, if not his life, was at
stake.</p>

<p>It is possible if the Peruvian had laid to and allowed
the other to come up without the show of running away,
that it might have been permitted to continue its
course unmolested. And again it may not have been so.</p>

<p>At any rate the Peruvian captain held to his flight
as his only hope of salvation, until at last a shot,
better directed than the random firing so long kept
up, struck the doomed merchantman fairly amidship.</p>

<p>The craft instantly lurched and trembled from bow
to stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is sinking!&rdquo; shrieked the captain.
&ldquo;Quick--to the boats!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_21"></a>Chapter XXI</h1>
<h2>A Panic on Shipboard</h2>

<p>A scene of the wildest description followed the frantic
captain&rsquo;s announcement and order. The sailors
were panic stricken, and more than half of them plunged
headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>The captain was scarcely less distracted than his
men, and he only added to the helplessness of the
situation by his words and actions.</p>

<p>Jack tried to pacify him by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, se&ntilde;or capitan, but the ship will
not sink at once if at all. You have plenty of time
in which to save your lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Chilian! We shall be made prisoners
of war. Heaven protect me! I was a fool to listen
to you, Se&ntilde;or North.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too late to think of that now. It is
your duty to see if something cannot be done to stop
the ship&rsquo;s leak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was useless to try to reason with the Peruvian
captain. He was sure the ship was going to sink, and
seemed determined that she should.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Chilian continued to draw nearer, though
it had nearly stopped firing.</p>

<p>The trumpet-like tone of the commander rang over the
water just as the terrified Peruvians lowered a boat
and leaped headlong into it, that is, those who had
not previously jumped into the sea.</p>

<p>Finding himself alone on the sinking vessel, which
was going down fast, Jack answered the Chilian&rsquo;s
challenge:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy! what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The merchant ship, <i>Santa Clara</i>,
Se&ntilde;or Captain, now sinking from the effects of your
shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay to and I&rsquo;ll come aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This command was not obeyed.</p>

<p>The doomed vessel was now lurching fearfully, and
Jack knew that he could not leave it any too soon
for his own safety of life. Fortunately the shore
was not so far away but he believed he could reach
it, and throwing off his outer garments, he leaped
into the water.</p>

<p>The Peruvians were struggling in every direction,
the boat having been upset by them in their mad endeavors
to save themselves. Jack knew that the farther he
got away from them and the quicker he did it, the better
it would be for him. He left them in their furious,
but futile, efforts to escape or drown, as their attempts
for life deserved.</p>

<p>After swimming a short distance he looked back to
find that he was just in season to witness the fate
of the ship. He saw her make a sudden lurch forward,
and then she seemed to right herself for a moment,
but it was her death struggle, for with the next breath
she went downward, quickly disappearing from sight
forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another plan gone wrong,&rdquo; thought Jack,
&ldquo;and again I am where I began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A less courageous youth than Jack North must have
given up then, but with the stern determination of
his nature not to give up, he resumed his swimming,
reaching the land half an hour later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is worse than before,&rdquo; he said ruefully,
as he viewed his drenched figure, &ldquo;for I did
save my coat then. Yes, and my cargo of nitrate is
still on the mountain waiting for me. I think I will
toss up a cent to see what I shall do next. No! come
to think of it, I haven&rsquo;t got the cent to do
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His first thought was to return to the machine shop
in Tocopilla, but as De la Pama was nearer he decided
to go there in the morning. &ldquo;It is useless for
me to remain here,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;I wonder
how many of the Peruvians have escaped? They were
a set of cowards anyway, and the captain the biggest
fool of them all. I hope he will make good use of my
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laid down supperless that night under the green
blanket of a Peruvian forest, and he went on toward
De la Pama the next morning breakfastless, thinking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing certain, I will not take
Plum&rsquo;s job from him. If he has no fireman, and
will accept me, I will go as his helper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he did not seek immediately his friend, almost
the first person he saw in town was Plum. It would
be difficult to say which was the more surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! not gone to the States, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something gone wrong, Jack, again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About my usual luck, Plum. I am where I began--without
a cent in my pocket,&rdquo; and he quickly told the
other what had befallen him since they had parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, Jack, but I&rsquo;ll tell
you what I&rsquo;ll do. I have what amounts to three
hundred dollars that I&rsquo;ve saved and every dollar
of it is yours till you can pay it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not think of taking your hard earnings,
Plum, for it is uncertain if I should ever be able
to pay it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you from the bottom of my heart, but
must look for work again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shall have my job, Jack. I had rather
fire anyway; honest, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you again, Plum, and it&rsquo;s just
like your generosity, but I cannot rob you of your
situation. How does your fireman do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tip-top, I am sorry to say. To tell the truth,
Jack, he does so well I am afraid he will get my job
away from me. I wish you would take the lever again,
Jack, and let me fire. I never had so good a time in
my life as I did then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a little past noon, and a few minutes later
Jack would be obliged to part with Plum, who must
start on his return to St. Resa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one favor you can do me, Plum. If
you will lend me money enough to buy a pair of oxen
I will begin to team a cargo of nitrate down myself.
I do not feel you will take much risk in letting me
have that amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish you would take more, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have hit on a better plan this time,&rdquo;
said Jack, as he took the loan. &ldquo;I am going
to draw enough for a shipload down on the Bolivian
coast and house it there until an American ship comes
into harbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may have to wait a long time, but it will
be best in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his oldtime vivacity Jack set out on his new
undertaking. He soon found a yoke of oxen to his liking,
and finding he had money enough he bought a second
pair. Then he started for the mountain ridge where
he had so unceremoniously left his two loads of nitrate
so long before.</p>

<p>He did not expect to recover the one that had gone
over the precipice, though it had not moved from its
singular position. To his joy he found the other just
where he had left it. The rust had gathered on the
iron-work and the sun had discolored the wood, but
the wagon was in running order, and as the path from
this point was generally descending he had no trouble
in drawing the load, though his team consisted of one
yoke of oxen less than before.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to follow him in his long, lonely
journeys to Cobija, on the coast of Bolivia, where
he stored his nitrate until he had there enough for
a ship&rsquo;s cargo. During the time his cattle lived
by feeding on the grass that grew on the more fertile
places along the route, while he lived on whatever
food he could pick up, sleeping at night under his
cart.</p>

<p>He had no further use for his oxen, so he sold them
at the first favorable opportunity, realizing enough
for them to pay back the money he had borrowed of
his friend, with a fair rate of interest. Surely he
had made a more auspicious beginning this time.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_22"></a>Chapter XXII</h1>
<h2>The Fate of Plum Plucky</h2>

<p>It had been three months since Jack had seen Plum,
so he resolved to go to De la Pama and see his friend
before making another move in his venture. But he
had not left town before he was surprised to meet his
friend, who had come to Cobija in search of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost my job and so I thought I would hunt you
up,&rdquo; said the latter, bluntly. &ldquo;Got a
stunning piece of news for you, too. There is an American
brig ship just above here at the next town, and I made
bold to ask him to take your cargo to New York. He
says he will do it for a snip in the profits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a bit of news worth hearing, and in the exuberance
of his spirits, Jack flung his cap high into the air
and threw his arms about the neck of his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last I believe my dream will be fulfilled,
but I shall never forget it was you who helped to
accomplish it. But I want to pay the money I owe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Jack; better keep it awhile longer.
I know it is safe. You may need it you know. Besides
I am going to the States with you. I have got enough
of this country. The war grows hotter and hotter up
St. Resa way. I am homesick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in seeing the captain of the brig,
a man named Hillgrove, and who gave our hero a most
cordial greeting. He had been in Bouton daring his
adventurous career, though he could give Jack no information
of his friends. He knew John Fowler, the great engine
builder, and that simple fact gave him confidence
in the young speculator, who must have presented a
not very favorable appearance to him.</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s long exposure to the tropical sun had
fairly blackened his countenance, his hair was long
and unkempt, while his clothes were sadly in need
of repair, or more truthfully new ones to take their
place. But there was an honest frankness in his manner,
and Captain Hillgrove entered into the spirit of the
venture with a hearty good-will. The bluff old sea
dog, too, true to his nature, was anxious to get out
to sea again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must and will get out of this infernal country
within a week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I will run
down to Cobija as soon as possible, and if your nitrates
is on board by that time the old <i>Elizabeth</i>
will be good-natured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plum having decided to go home with Jack, it was necessary
for him to return to De la Pama for his money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be back sure, Jack, on the third, if
not before,&rdquo; were his parting words.</p>

<p>Captain Hillgrove ran into Cobija the next morning,
when the loading of the nitrates was begun with as
little delay as possible, Jack feeling in the best
of spirits as he superintended the work.</p>

<p>But on the eve of the third day, Jack having got the
last of the cargo aboard a little after noon, to his
anxiety, Plum Plucky had not appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will surely come before morning, unless
something has happened to him, for I never knew Plum
to break his word,&rdquo; said Jack to the skipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait any longer!&rdquo; declared
captain Hillgrove the following morning, when it was
found that Plum was still missing. &ldquo;We shall
all be confiscated by these infernal Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was now really alarmed about his friend, whom
he believed had been waylaid and robbed. But he could
not think of leaving without making a search for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to start for De la Pama to look
for him, but you may expect me back by sunset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are not I shall set sail without you,
for I have seen some of the Chilian spies around today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not wait any longer than sunset,&rdquo;
said Jack, who could not blame the other for his impatience.</p>

<p>Losing no more time, Jack mounted a fleet pony that
he had hired at an exorbitant price, and set out for
De la Pama at a furious pace.</p>

<p>Toward noon he was gladdened by the sight of an inhabitant
of the town whom he knew, and who was on his way to
Cobija.</p>

<p>Halting the Peruvian he inquired of him in regard
to Plum. This fellow, who knew Plum well, replied
that he had seen him in town, and that he had left
two days before. Upon second thought, he volunteered
the startling information that news had come of an
American being waylaid and killed by a party of bush-raiders
a dozen miles east of De la Pama!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the young engineer start directly for Cobija?&rdquo;
asked Jack anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he went toward the east, saying he wished
to go to Don de Estuaray before he went to Cobija.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was sufficient to arouse the fears of Jack, who
procured a fresh horse and put on as rapidly as possible
across the wild country toward the estancia of Don
de Estuaray.</p>

<p>All the afternoon he rode as fast as he could, but
he saw nothing of his missing friend. In his anxiety
he halted on top of an eminence of land commanding
a wide view of the surrounding country, to scan the
lonely scene.</p>

<p>His attention was finally caught and held by the flight
of one of those enormous vultures of the Andes, which
was descrying a circle in the air directly over the
valley at his feet. Smaller and smaller grew the orbit
of this dark bird while he watched, until suddenly
it ended its gyrations and swooped swiftly down out
of sight.</p>

<p>Then a second took its place in the air, soon following
it to the earth, in turn succeeded by a third, and
that by another, and so on, until a dozen had come
and gone in this mysterious way.</p>

<p>With a dread foreboding at his heart, Jack rode forward
into the isolated valley, when, from a small opening
in the centre of the place the sudden whir of wings
and the rapid flight of many dark bodies told him the
secret of it all.</p>

<p>He found what he expected a moment later--the bones
of a human being picked clean of all flesh by the
vultures, while scattered here and there were shreds
and pieces of the garments worn by the unfortunate
person.</p>

<p>He found enough of the clothes to know only too well
that they belonged to his lost friend Plum Plucky,
and tears filled his eyes as he turned away to shut
out the sad spectacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is fearful!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Poor,
poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this very moment, though of course unknown to him,
tired of waiting for him any longer, Captain Hillgrove
was sailing out of Gobija harbor, anxious to reach
the open sea before night should set in.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_23"></a>Chapter XXIII</h1>
<h2>Jenny</h2>

<p>The vultures were still screaming over his head, venting
their rage over being disturbed in their feast, as
Jack hastily brushed the tears from his eyes and looked
more clearly around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Plum!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this
is indeed a sad fate. It seems a certain fatality
for any one to be my friend. But I suppose you were
killed for your money. It seems only decent that I
should give your bones human burial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his knife and the stirrups taken from the trappings
of his horse, Jack hollowed out a spot to receive
all that was left of the body he had found.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished the sad task it was quite
dark in the forest, so he knew he must get away from
the lonely place as soon as possible, if he valued
his own life.</p>

<p>With a last farewell look at the wildwood grave which
he was never to see again, he rode away through the
wilderness.</p>

<p>He soon found, however, that his horse was so spent
that it must have rest before going much further.</p>

<p>As impatient as he was to reach Cobija, wondering
what Captain Hillgrove would think of his prolonged
absence, he yielded to the unavoidable and stopped
awhile in the heart of the forest.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when he rode into De la Pama
on a used up horse and himself quite fagged out.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding his condition, he felt obliged
to push on for Cobija, dreading lest he should find
Captain Hillgrove already gone. Accordingly remounting
the pony he had previously ridden, he started for the
sea coast at a rapid gait.</p>

<p>The wiry little animal made a remarkable record, but
he might as well have been on the road another day,
as it seemed, for he found his worst fears realized.</p>

<p>Captain Hillgrove had sailed!</p>

<p>Whither should he turn now? What should he do? Never
in his life had he felt so lonely and so near despair
as he did at that time. The indomitable pluck which
had carried him through so many trials began to leave
him. Then, he rallied, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will earn money enough to take me back to
the United States on the first ship that comes this
way. Perhaps with a sample of my nitrate I------&rdquo;</p>

<p>He suddenly felt a heavy hand laid on his shoulder,
and turning he was both astonished and pleased to
find one of the seaman of the <i>Elizabeth</i>
standing beside him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, shipmate!&rdquo; greeted the sailor,
giving the true nautical pitch, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve
follered you into port at last, though it&rsquo;s a
sorry cruise I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Hillgrove!&rdquo; cried Jack, elated.
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Outside, shipmate. He durstn&rsquo;t stay inside
longer, and he sent me to keep a lookout for you.
I was giving you up when I clapped my old watchdogs
on you. You are ready to go out to the <i>Elizabeth</i>
in my boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s reply was an exclamation of joy and a
more fervant grip of the honest old tar&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Hillgrove had not deserted me after
all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without further trouble or delay the couple made the
trip to the waiting vessel, when Jack was greeted
by the bluff old skipper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my eyes! but I had given you up to old
Davy Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought you had left me in the lurch,&rdquo;
said Jack frankly, as he cringed under the grip given
his hand by the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not dare stay in Cobija longer, my hearty.
If I had done so nary a bit of your dust would have
been left on the <i>Elizabeth</i>. Bless my eyes!
but I&rsquo;m just overflowing and roaring glad--run
up the yards lads. Lively, lads! put the old <i>Elizabeth</i>
on her wings. We must be a long way from here afore
sun-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exciting scenes followed, of which Jack was a spectator
and not an actor. For the present his work was done,
and he had time now to ponder upon his ups and downs,
hardly able to believe that at last he was really on
his homeward journey. He felt far more confident in
the care of bluff Captain Hillgrove than in that of
the fickle Peruvians.</p>

<p>Nor was his confidence misplaced, for the night passed
without anything occurring to interrupt their progress,
and when the sun rose the following morning it found
them many leagues from land, and bowling merrily on
their way.</p>

<p>Captain Hillgrove listened to his account of the fate
of poor Plum Plucky with a feeling of sorrow, though
he had never met the young American.</p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s return home was something of a triumph,
though he was saddened by the loss of his companion
during those trying scenes he could not put from his
mind, while his longings to reach home were tinged
with those forebodings one cannot escape who has been
away so long, and the nearer he approached his native
land the more ominous became those feelings!</p>

<p>Were his parents still living and well? Was--was Jenny
still true to him? What had she thought of his long,
weary years of absence? Until then he had not realized
that he had been away so long.</p>

<p>At last the old <i>Elizabeth</i> was safely moored
at her dock.</p>

<p>Though Captain Hillgrove was anxious to know what
the result of their speculation was going to be, he
allowed Jack time to hunt up his relatives and friends
before the nitrate was moved from the ship&rsquo;s
hold.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain the joyous reception accorded
our hero at his home, for many had given him up as
dead.</p>

<p>With a tremulous tongue he asked for Jenny dreading,
doubting, expecting he knew not what; and then his
cup of happiness overflowed at the thrice-welcome
news of her well-being and faithfulness to him, and
that she had just returned to her native town.</p>

<p>Jenny was not only living and well, but she had never
given up looking for him, believing he would some
day return to her.</p>

<p>The sweet happiness of the meeting between the pair
is too sacred to be revealed.</p>

<p>When the first transport of his reception home had
passed, Jack proceeded to put on the market his ship-load
of nitrate, to be met with another rebuff in the checkered
wheel of fortune.</p>

<p>He could find no one with faith in the virtue of his
product brought from the wilds of South America.</p>

<p>Captain Hillgrove began to think he had made a profitless
voyage, though be it said to his credit, he stood
ever by Jack.</p>

<p>The latter met the words of scorn uttered against
him with his characteristic good-nature. Some of the
nitrate was put in the hands of competent chemists,
and still more with practical agriculturists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall win out,&rdquo; said Jack confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust so with all my heart,&rdquo; answered
Jenny.</p>

<p>At last some favorable reports came in and then the
load of nitrates was sold at a fair profit. Of the
amount Jack got several hundred dollars, the rest
going to the captain of the <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_24"></a>Chapter XXIV</h1>
<h2>Jack and the Ocelot</h2>

<p>The one most satisfied with the result of this first
cargo of nitrate was Captain Hillgrove. He had not
expected great returns, but found himself so well
paid that he was willing to return for another load
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Jack felt confident of his ultimate success. Already
he was the possessor of a fair sum, and with the apparently
unlimited deposits of nitrate now in his possession,
he believed he could easily secure a fortune. As soon
as he should get back to Peru he resolved to get possession
of other nitrate beds before the price should advance.</p>

<p>But with that far-seeing sagacity of his he made no
talk of what he had done or what he had in mind. Quietly
he went about his work, engaging several ships to
go to South America with him, prepared to return with
loads of the precious substance. He fitted up an office
at home and put a trusty man in the place to begin
to work up a business. He had fondly looked forward
to giving this place to Plum Plucky, but stern fate
had decreed different plans.</p>

<p>Jenny was enthusiastic over her Jack&rsquo;s plans,
and that they might not be separated so long again
she consented to their marriage, which took place
before he started on his second trip to Peru, and she
accompanied him.</p>

<p>Now that Jack had really got started in his speculations,
he studied how best he might promote his interest.
His young wife going with him to South America, he
resolved to locate in that country until he had got
fairly under control the gigantic business he intended
to build up.</p>

<p>While successful in his nitrate ventures, he still
preserved the manuscript he had picked up in the convict
cell on the island of Robinson Crusoe, and he looked
forward to the time when he should be able to visit
the strange lake in the Andes with means to reach its
mysterious island of buried treasure.</p>

<p>So at last, accompanied by a party of surveyors and
explorers, armed with papers which would make him
the owner of the whole region as soon as the boundaries
could be fixed, he started for the place.</p>

<p>He had told his real object to no one, knowing that
to do so would be to ruin his prospects without benefiting
any one permanently.</p>

<p>He had no difficulty in leading the way to the spur
of the Andes where he had met with his thrilling experience
with the jaguars, and then the party started for the
rocky ridge overlooking the niche in the mountains
holding the Devil&rsquo;s Waters.</p>

<p>It was a route that Jack had traveled several times,
and feeling in the best of spirits, he set off on
a galop, on the pony he was riding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Plum!&rdquo; he murmured, as he rode along.
&ldquo;How I wish he was a live to enjoy this with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On and on went our hero until he came to where there
was a break in the trail. He was absorbed in thought
at the time and did not notice that his pony turned
to the left instead of the right.</p>

<p>The way seemed easy, and presently the pony set off
on a galop, which soon brought Jack out of his revery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo! where am I going?&rdquo; he asked himself,
and brought his steed to a halt. Then he gazed around
in perplexity. &ldquo;I declare I must be lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the memory of what had happened when he had been
lost before, Jack lost no time in turning back. But
soon he became bewildered, and brought his steed to
a standstill a second time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Firefly?&rdquo; he asked
of the pony, but the animal could not answer.</p>

<p>Jack heaved a sigh and then drew a pistol he carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fire a shot--that will attract the
attention of the others,&rdquo; he reasoned. &ldquo;What
a dunce I was to get lost! I surely make a fine leader!&rdquo;
Throwing up the pistol he discharged it. Hardly had
he done so when his pony started to bolt. Away dashed
the steed under some trees and then through a mass
of vines, and Jack was thrown to the ground, striking
on his head as he fell,--and then his senses forsook
him.</p>

<p>How long he laid where he had fallen he did not know
exactly but when he came to his senses, it was to
find darkness around him. There was no rain, but heavy
clouds filled the air and a heavy breeze filled the
woods around him.  He got up slowly, to make certain
that no bones were broken, and then looked around
for his pony. The animal had disappeared and could
not be found. His pistol was also gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am surely in a pickle,&rdquo; reasoned
Jack. &ldquo;The question is, what am I to do next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew his party must have gone on long before this.
He would have to find them in some way. But how?</p>

<p>Not relishing a stay in the bushes he started for
higher ground. He had not gone a dozen rods when he
found himself at the edge of a ravine, lined with
tall trees and vines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not come that way,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;But beyond is higher ground
and I had better go up than down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus reasoning, he looked around for some means of
getting over the ravine. A number of vines grew across,
and he determined to test them and if they were strong
enough, to use them as a rope for getting across.</p>

<p>The vines appeared to be as firm as a cable, and without
giving the matter a second thought he launched himself
forth and started to the other side of the cut in
the forest.</p>

<p>He had progressed less than two yards when he felt
one end of the vines giving way. He tried to turn
back, but it was too late, and down he went.</p>

<p>Some heavy bushes broke his fall somewhat, but he
continued to go down and down, until with a dull thud
he landed on a mass of soft dirt. He was unharmed
and soon arose to his feet, to gaze around in fresh
dismay.</p>

<p>He had landed in an opening or cave, and presently
went down into it still further. Then, as he picked
himself up, he heard a sudden low growl, that filled
him with fear. He strained his eyes and made out a
small animal, which proved to be the cub of an ocelot.</p>

<p>He followed its course to a litter of leaves and straining
his glance in that direction made out two other cubs.</p>

<p>They were too small to be dangerous. Plum had told
him that there were very few ocelots in that vicinity
and these rather cowardly, unless attacked or enraged.</p>

<p>Jack looked hurriedly around. The parent ocelot was
not in evidence. The baby cub he had stumbled over,
however, was making a great outcry, and our hero decided
he would not linger any longer than was necessary.</p>

<p>He got under the hole he had fallen through. It was
not accessible by climbing, for the walls of the cave
were perfectly perpendicular and came nowhere near
the central aperture.</p>

<p>Jack reached up and caught at the dangling end of
the broken vine. It sustained one hard pull, but,
as he set his full weight, it tore up roots and all,
bringing down a shower of dirt and gravel.</p>

<p>About eight feet over his head the youth made out
an exposed root of the tree. It ran out of the solid
dirt a few inches, looped, and was again solidly imbedded.</p>

<p>If he could reach this, he could grasp higher pieces
of roots that showed plainly, and easily draw himself
to <i>terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>Our hero went back to the extreme end of the cave.
The young cubs set up outcries of affright as he passed
near them, but he paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>He braced for a run and a jump to reach the piece
of root that was the bottom rung of a natural ladder
to liberty.</p>

<p>Poised on one foot, Jack stood motionless in some
dismay. The entrance to the cave was suddenly darkened.
A great heavy body dropped through. The mother ocelot
landed on four feet on the cave floor with a terrific
growl.</p>

<p>She ran first to her crying cubs, nosed them affectionately,
and then turned with low, ominous growlings.</p>

<p>Jack saw the beast&rsquo;s eyes fix themselves upon
him. They glowed with fire and fury. Its collar ruffled
and its white teeth showed.</p>

<p>Jack had not so much as a stick to defend himself
with. He had loaned his hunting knife to a friend
when they first started and his pistol had been dropped
in the woods.</p>

<p>In his pocket was a small pocket knife. He was groping
for this when the ocelot, that had for a minute or
two stood perfectly motionless, made a forward movement.</p>

<p>It was not a spring or a glide, but a rush. Jack knew
why they called this species the Honey Eater. Its
paws were enormous and armed with long curved sharp
pointed claws.</p>

<p>He was hedged in. The beast, still advancing, reared
on its hind feet.</p>

<p>Its forepaws were extended and whipping the air. Jack
knew that one contact would tear the bark from the
toughest tree. He mechanically seized the first object
his groping fingers met in his coat pocket.</p>

<p>It was one of two condiment bottles that he had brought
from the last camp. This was the one containing pepper.</p>

<p>In a desperate sort of a way Jack discovered this.
He tore off the top of the bottle.</p>

<p>It was all that he could do to stay the course of
the determined animal.</p>

<p>As the ocelot thrust out one formidable paw to tear
its victim into its clasp, Jack flung the contents
of the pepper bottle squarely into its eyes.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_25"></a>Chapter XXV</h1>
<h2>In the Quicksands</h2>

<p>Jack ducked down and dodged the ocelot, and got past
the animal. He could do this now, for the whole contents
of the pepper bottle had gone squarely into the eyes
of the beast.</p>

<p>The effect was indescribable. The animal gave a frightful
roar, dropped to the floor, and, rolling over and
over, tore frantically with its paws at its blinded,
smarting eyes.</p>

<p>The cubs, excited and frightened by the uproar, joined
in the chorus. They waddled around, getting in our
hero&rsquo;s way, and by their cries arousing the
mother from her own distress.</p>

<p>She got upright, and seemed to spot Jack. Her advance,
however, was clumsy and at fault, and the youth had
time to get out of her way.</p>

<p>A second and a third rush she made at him. The last
time one paw struck Jack&rsquo;s coat sleeve and ripped
it from place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is getting serious,&rdquo; murmured the
lad. &ldquo;Each time she comes swifter and surer.
I must get out of here, now or never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack drove the cubs to their litter, and poked them
with his foot. They set up a frantic uproar. This
was just what he wanted. The mother flew towards her
offspring.</p>

<p>The moment that she did so, Jack glided to the opposite
wall of the cave.</p>

<p>He made a sharp run for the opening overhead, calculated
poise and distance nicely, and landed with success.</p>

<p>He grabbed the rounding root. It held like iron, but
his feet were dangling, and as he swayed there the
big ocelot brushed by them on the hunt for the intruder.</p>

<p>Jack held firmly to the root and swung up his other
hand. He caught at a higher tree root. Now he had
a double hold.</p>

<p>He knew that the ocelot might come after him even
up there, and lost no time in climbing from root to
root. At last his head projected through the mesh
of verdure into clear daylight. Jack lifted himself
to solid ground and leaned against the tree trunk,
out of breath and perspiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was action,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Will
the beast come after me? No--but something else may.
Oh, the mischief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roars and growlings down in the cave seemed to
have attracted outside attention. Jack turned sharply,
at the sound of crackling branches and rustling leaves
at a densely-verdured spot near at hand.</p>

<p>There burst through the greenery a new enemy. This
was an ocelot larger than the one he had just escaped
from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the head of the family, sure,&rdquo;
thought Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a race, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new feature in the incident came straight for
our hero, with bristling muzzle and fiery eyes. Jack
started down the edge of the ravine.</p>

<p>It crumbled so that he could not make very rapid progress.
To turn aside into the jungle meant to fight his way
through thick, thorny bushes. To leap down into the
dry water-course was even worse. There, as he knew,
the spongy, shifting sand bottom would prevent even
the progress of a decent walk.</p>

<p>Jack glanced back over his shoulder. The big ocelot,
more sure-footed than himself, was following him up
resolutely.</p>

<p>Jack took the first tree he came to. It was a dead
one. There were lower branches within reach, and he
swung himself up to its first crotch readily. The
ocelot did not pause. It started up the tree without
delay. Jack armed himself with a piece of a thick
limb. Reaching down, as the beast got about four feet
away, he delivered a smart whack directly across its
snout.</p>

<p>The animal issued a terrific snort. Its eyes blazed
madly. A second blow with the club brought the blood,
but it kept on climbing.</p>

<p>Jack knew that it would be folly to tempt to battle
at any closer quarters. He stood on a dead limb about
twenty feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The limb was as thick as his arm, and over thirty
feet long. It ran clear across the ravine, and a discovery
of this fact gave Jack an idea.</p>

<p>He planned to go out to the far end of the limb, swing
from its extremity and drop to the ground, landing
on the ether bank of the cut.</p>

<p>The ocelot could not get hold or balance to venture
as far out on the limb as the lad dared to go. Jack
calculated that the time it lost in getting down to
the ground again, would enable him to meantime put
a considerable distance between himself and the enemy.</p>

<p>The lad sat astride the dead tree branch and began
to walk himself outward from the main trunk of the
tree.</p>

<p>The ocelot reached the crotch, surveyed Jack with
a savage growl, and carefully planting its feet, started
out after him.</p>

<p>Its progress was slow. Jack hitched himself along
more rapidly. The branch began to creak. Our hero
doubted if it would sustain their double weight. However,
he trusted to the wary instinct of the ocelot, which
kept coming right forward. Jack was about eight feet
from the end of the branch when it gave a very ominous
crack. In fact, he saw the white splinters show where
it joined the tree.</p>

<p>He swung both feet to one side of the limb, held on
only by his fingers, and planned to get to its end
hand over hand.</p>

<p>Snap! Jack hurried progress, but it was no use. He
saw the ocelot crouch and hug the limb. It gave way
at its base. Jack let go. He landed directly on the
smooth, sandy bottom of that portion of the ravine.</p>

<p>He struck the ground upright, squarely with both feet.
Glancing quickly at the tree, he saw that the branch
had whipped right down against the trunk.</p>

<p>The limb had not entirely broken loose, but swayed
from several sustaining wood filaments. The ocelot,
still hugging the limb, was clawing frantically at
the main trunk of the tree to get a new hold there
to keep from a tumble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to stop, I see that,&rdquo;
murmured Jack. &ldquo;Ugh! what kind of a mushy mess
have I got into?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack looked down at his feet. They had sunk into the
sand and were covered to the ankles. With the greatest
difficulty he pulled out one foot.</p>

<p>The instant he put it down again in a new spot, however,
it sank afresh. He released the other. This threw
his weight on a single foot, which went down half
way to the knee.</p>

<p>It was not ten feet to the bank of the ravine. Jack
lost all interest in the ocelot as he thrilled at
a startling discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quicksand!&rdquo; he breathed hastily. &ldquo;There
is not a moment to lose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our hero tugged to get the sunken foot free. He succeeded.
Then, half-dancing about, he threw himself flat.</p>

<p>His idea was to make a hurried scramble for the bank
on hands and knees. But he uttered a cry of the greatest
alarm as his hands went down into the treacherous
mass clear to the wrists.</p>

<p>It took a great effort to get upright again. By the
time he had done so, Jack realized that he was in
a most serious and critical situation.</p>

<p>He was sunk now clear to the knees in a weaving, shifting
mass. It circled his imprisoned limbs like great moving
ropes, pulling him downward with a suction force that
was tremendous.</p>

<p>The youth uttered a grasp of real horror. He could
not budge either limb. As he sank to the thighs, he
gave himself up for lost.</p>

<p>He saw that no help of any kind whatever was at hand.
He knew that the camp of the men who had come with
him must be near. He raised his voice to a desperate
pitch.</p>

<p>He let out a series of the most piercing yells. But
his heart sank, as from the neighboring jungle there
instantly arose a mocking imitation from the throats
of several parrots.</p>

<p>They drowned out his cries for help. Jack shuddered
as the shifting sands wound about his waist. He drew
up his tingling fingers with a shock as the mass swept
them in ominous, warning contact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the last of me,&rdquo; thought Jack,
as tears of despair came to his eyes. &ldquo;Jenny
and the folks will never know my fate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack looked up at the dark sky, sick at heart, but
trying to resign himself to the terrible fate that
hung over him.</p>

<p>His glance shifted to the tree. He instinctively dodged
his head to one side as he did so. Something spirited
was happening there.</p>

<p>The ocelot had got a clutch on the main tree trunk,
now. As it let go of the dangling limb, however, this
parted under the strain.</p>

<p>Its small end struck the ground, and it swung out,
coming for Jack and threatened to crush him.</p>

<p>The limb fell with a crash, the big end just reaching
the west side of the ravine. Its centre grazed our
hero&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am saved!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>

<p>He threw one arm tightly around the limb, then the
other. Now he was clinging to a natural bridge spanning
the ravine from one side to the other.</p>

<p>Jack held on and tugged hard to draw himself up from
this quicksand bath.</p>

<p>It was hard work. Finally he got one limb free, then
the other. They were numb, and felt like pieces of
lead.</p>

<p>Jack was so exhausted with the effort that, crawling
on top of the limb, he lay there lengthwise, almost
exhausted.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_26"></a>Chapter XXVI</h1>
<h2>A Night in the Jungle</h2>

<p>It was a good quarter of an hour before Jack felt
like making another move. As he lay on the log he
kept a lookout for the ocelots, but neither of the
beasts appeared, the larger having gone to the cave-like
opening to learn what was the matter with its mate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get away from this vicinity,&rdquo;
thought our hero, and at last started off.</p>

<p>He scarcely knew in what direction to turn, for the
running away of his pony and his adventures with the
wild beasts and in the quicksands had completely bewildered
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a good round sum to be back
with our party,&rdquo; he thought, as he pushed his
way through the jungle. &ldquo;I wonder if they are
out searching for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he had to rest again, and thinking himself
safe for the time being he set about cleaning his
hands and face, and also his outfit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is certainly treasure hunting with a vengeance,&rdquo;
he mused. &ldquo;I think I would have done better
had I stuck to the nitrates. Maybe I&rsquo;ll lose
my life and the vultures will pick my bones, just
as they did poor Plum&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It made our hero more dismal than ever to think of
how Plum had departed, and he was very sober as night
drew on and he still found himself alone and with
no idea of where he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stay here alone in the dark,&rdquo;
he said, half aloud. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be pleasant,
but it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon it was so dark that to advance further would
have been foolish.</p>

<p>Accordingly Jack came to a halt, and looked around
for some means of making himself comfortable for the
night.</p>

<p>He did not deem it wise to remain on the ground, where
some wild beast might leap upon him, and so looked
for some wide-spreading tree among whose branches
he might rest in peace.</p>

<p>At length he found a tree to his liking and having
taken a final look around, ascended to a number of
the upper branches.</p>

<p>Here there was a sort of natural platform, where he
might lie without much danger of falling to the ground.</p>

<p>It was now pitch dark, the clouds obscuring the stars
in the heavens. He was very hungry but had absolutely
nothing with which to gratify his appetite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get something for breakfast,&rdquo;
he reasoned. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll be
likely to starve to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was but natural that Jack should find sleep difficult,
and it was a good two hours before he went off soundly.
When he awoke it was with a start.</p>

<p>Jack listened intently, for he realized that some
movement at the foot of the tree had awakened him.
He tried to look downward, but the darkness and the
leaves hid everything from view. He waited with bated
breath and soon heard a faint scratching. That some
wild animal was at the foot of the tree he had no
doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t try to come up,&rdquo;
he thought. &ldquo;If it does, what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not dare to make a noise, and so remained silently
on guard. The minutes went by slowly, until a good
hour had passed. The noises below continued but that
was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even if the beast can&rsquo;t get up
it evidently intends to tree me,&rdquo; thought Jack,
dismally.</p>

<p>Sleep was out of the question, and rather impatiently
the youth waited for the coming of dawn.</p>

<p>At last came a faint light in the east and at last
daylight was at hand.</p>

<p>For some time Jack had heard no further noises below
him and he fondly hoped the thing on the ground--whatever
it was--had gone away. But now the noise was repeated,
and then came another sound that made him start in
wonder and anticipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible!&rdquo; he murmured, and
began to climb down the tree with all speed. Soon
he reached the lower branches, and looking downward
saw his pony resting directly under him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blind luck!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And I thought
it was a wild beast! How foolish I was not to come
down and take a look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not to scare the pony, Jack called out softly, at
which the steed pricked up its ears. Then our hero
slid down the tree to the ground and caught the pony
by the head. It did not offer to run away, but whinnied
with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>It gave Jack great pleasure to find the pony again,
and he felt far less lonely than he had during the
night. He mounted into the saddle, and, guided by
the sun turned in the direction where he thought the
mountain trail might lie.</p>

<p>It was a dull day, a peculiar smoky air filling the
jungle.</p>

<p>From a distance came the cry of wild birds, but that
was all.</p>

<p>Jack journeyed for a good two hours, and then came
to what looked like another ravine. But the banks
were not so steep as before and he had but little
difficulty in going down one side and getting up the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the cry that burst from his lips half an
hour later. A moment before he had realized that the
surroundings looked familiar. Now, on the ground before
him, he saw his lost pistol, shining among the grass
and leaves.</p>

<p>He lost no time in securing the weapon. It was ready
for use and with great satisfaction he placed it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got something with which to
defend myself,&rdquo; he reasoned. &ldquo;It may not
be as good as a gun, but it is better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Onward he went once more, stopping once to get some
handsful of berries which he knew were good to eat,
and then again for a drink of water for himself and
his steed. He had left his former trail, fearful of
going in a circle once more,--a common experience
of those traveling in a dense forest.</p>

<p>By noon Jack was more than hungry and he decided to
shoot something and cook it for a meal. He kept his
eyes open, and when some plump birds came close, brought
down two with ease. Then a fire was lit, and he spitted
the birds and broiled them to his satisfaction. He
took his time over the meal, allowing his pony to
graze in the meanwhile. Close at hand was a spring
of cold, mountain water and at this he quenched his
thirst, and the pony did the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that makes me feel better,&rdquo; said
the youth to himself. &ldquo;It will last me until
nightfall, and by that time I ought to be able to find
the others of the party, or gain some regular trail
which leads to somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So speaking Jack started to get into the saddle once
more. As he did so, he heard a rustling in the leaves
of some bushes behind the spring. The pony gave a
violent snort and gave a side step, which threw our
hero to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa there, Firefly!&rdquo; he called out.
&ldquo;Whoa, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But instead of quieting down, the pony became more
violent and it was impossible for Jack to hold the
steed. The pony broke away and like a flash whirled
around and disappeared once more into the jungle.</p>

<p>Somewhat bewildered, Jack stood up and gazed around
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; he asked himself.
The next instant he saw the reason for the pony&rsquo;s
extreme fright. A snake had appeared, coming rapidly
over the rocks. It was ten or twelve feet long and
as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm. It was hissing viciously
and had its glittering eyes fastened full upon our
hero!</p>

<h1><a name="ch_27"></a>Chapter XXVII</h1>
<h2>Jack and the Big Snake</h2>

<p>It was no wonder that Jack was both startled and alarmed.
The snake was certainly powerful, and the youth knew
that many of the reptiles of that vicinity were poisonous.
A sting might mean death, and if the snake should
wind itself about him, he might be strangled until
his breath was gone, never to return.</p>

<p>By instinct more than reason he leaped to one side.
At this the snake, hissing louder than ever, did likewise.
Then Jack made a wild leap into the air, caught a
low-hanging tree branch, and hauled himself upward.</p>

<p>For the time being our hero was clear of the snake,
but he felt far from comfortable. He perched himself
on the limb and watched the reptile closely. It whipped
this way and that over the ground as if in high anger
over missing its intended prey.</p>

<p>Thus several minutes passed. The snake circled the
tree three times and then began to come up with a
quickness that chilled Jack to the bone. There was
no help for it, and pulling his pistol, the youth blazed
away at the snake. The first shot took no effect,
but the second hit the reptile fairly in the body.
It whipped around its head for a moment, then came
forward as before.</p>

<p>Jack was as far out on the limb as he could get, and
now, as the snake came forward, he blazed away a third
and fourth time. Then he let himself drop to the ground.</p>

<p>As he did this, the reptile thrashed around wildly
in the tree, hitting one limb after another with its
tail. Then it came to the ground in a heap, writhing
horribly in its death agonies. Jack had wounded it
fatally, but the body would continue to move until
sundown, if not longer. When the scare was over the
youth found himself bathed in a cold perspiration and
trembling as if with the ague. He realized that he
had had a narrow escape, and thanked providence that
the snake was dead.</p>

<p>Jack did not remain in that vicinity long, but set
at once to work to find his pony. Fortunately the
animal had not gone far on this occasion and a call
soon brought the steed to the youth&rsquo;s side. Then
Jack hopped into the saddle once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious! what a lot of adventures I am having!&rdquo;
he murmured, as he again rode along. &ldquo;I hope
I don&rsquo;t have any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On and on through the forest rode Jack, gradually
gaining higher ground. The sun was breaking through
the smoky air and this did something towards raising
his spirits.</p>

<p>A good two miles covered, and our hero came out in
a clearing some distance above the jungle. Here he
could get a tolerable view of the surrounding country
and he looked eagerly for some trace of his party.
To the southward he made out what he took to be the
smoke of a camp-fire, but that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may as well turn in that direction,&rdquo;
he reasoned. &ldquo;Where there is a fire there must
be human beings. And as the war is now at an end it
isn&rsquo;t likely that they will harm me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some distance the new route was an easy one, but
then it became rougher and rougher, until riding was
all but impossible. At some points he had to dismount
and lead the pony. Once both went into a rocky hollow,
Jack barking a shin and the pony skinning a knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope this doesn&rsquo;t last very far,&rdquo;
thought the youth. The roughness continued a quarter
of a mile, when he came out on a beautiful grassy
plain, at the rear of which he saw a thatched house
and a small garden enclosure containing a score or
more of chickens.</p>

<p>As he approached the house an old man came forth to
meet him. He viewed Jack with astonishment, for visitors
in that lonely spot were rare. &ldquo;Where does the
most noble se&ntilde;or come from?&rdquo; he asked, bowing
low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came from the town far below here,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;I have lost my way,&rdquo; and
then as well as he was able he described the road he
wished to find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Americano</i> se&ntilde;or is a long distance
from that road,&rdquo; said the native.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you guide me to it?&rdquo; questioned the
youth, eagerly. &ldquo;I will pay you well for your
services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of pay the native showed an increased
interest. He was naturally a lazy fellow, but the
promise of a Peruvian half dollar made him hustle
to take Jack on his way. He too had a pony, and soon
the pair set off, across the plateau and then through
a sparingly grown forest, where some of the trees
were of enormous height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What had made the air so smoky?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, as they rode along. &ldquo;Have there been heavy
forest fires?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No forest fires, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; the native answered.
&ldquo;The smoke comes from the bowels of the earth.
The rocks have opened once more--we shall soon have
an earthquake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; cried Jack. He had experienced
several slight earthquakes while in that quarter of
the globe, and, though they had done small harm, he
dreaded the coming of another quake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two, three days, it may be--or perhaps a week,&rdquo;
answered the native.</p>

<p>After that they rode along in silence for fully half
a mile, when they reached a trail running east and
west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the road the se&ntilde;or is looking for?&rdquo;
asked the native, bringing his pony to a halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But
I must look around first to see if my party has passed
this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He surveyed the scene with care, but could find no
trace of the others. Had they come thus far, or had
they turned back, in a hunt for him? Jack was in a
quandary over what to do next. Night was again coming
on, and he had no desire to remain alone again, after
his many adventures of the past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can we stop around here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;or wants his humble servant to remain
with him over night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless some other house is handy, and
others there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a house not far away, but it is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us go to it. It will be better to
remain there than to stay in the open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went up the trail a short distance, and then
turned to the southward and took to a side road leading
through a patch of high brushwood. Crossing a tiny
mountain torrent, they came in sight of a dilapidated
house, one end of which was all but wrecked. To the
surprise of both Jack and his guide, smoke was issuing
from behind the structure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody must be here after all,&rdquo; said
the youth, as he rode forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be a stranger, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; was the
native&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>Not to fall into the hands of enemies Jack advanced
with caution. As he rounded the end of the dilapidated
house, he saw a bright fire burning among some piled-up
stones. In front of this fire a tall young man, dressed
in rags, was crouching, cooking something in a battered
pan. As Jack came closer the young man suddenly leaped
to his feet, uttering a cry of alarm. Then he gave
another cry, and dropping the pan with its contents
to the ground, he rushed forward with wide-stretched
arms yelling at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack! It is really my own Jack! Oh, how
glad I am to see yeou!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_28"></a>Chapter XXVIII</h1>
<h2>Back from the Dead</h2>

<p>Jack literally fell from his horse. Was he dreaming
or was this a ghost that confronted him? He gazed
at the other fellow with eyes that almost popped from
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t yeou glad to see me?&rdquo; came
from the fellow in rags, and his voice took on a hurt
tone. &ldquo;Plum! Is it--is it really you?&rdquo;
faltered Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure ez yeou air born it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo;
was the answer from Plum Plucky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were dead--I was sure you
were dead. Why, I--I buried your bones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by a jugful yeou didn&rsquo;t bury my bones,
Jack. I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em all with me, although
I allow they ain&rsquo;t much meat on &rsquo;em jest
now,&rdquo; went on Plum, dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this--this staggers me! I was certain you
were dead, and when I found a heap of bones which
the vultures had picked clean I buried them for yours.
This is the most wonderful thing I ever heard of. I
can&rsquo;t understand it. Where have you been, and
why didn&rsquo;t you let me hear from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been a prisoner of war,&rdquo; answered
Plum. &ldquo;Got caught in the mountains one day.
Fust they was up fer shootin&rsquo; me, but then they
changed their minds and carted me off to some little
town in the mountains. They fired me into a dungeon
an&rsquo; I took sick, an&rsquo; would have died only
a native gal up an&rsquo; nussed me back to health.
Then I give the gal some silver I had hidden away
an&rsquo; she showed me how to git away, an&rsquo;
I got. Then I got lost in the mountains, an&rsquo;
would have starved to death only I run down some sort
o&rsquo; a wild beast that had two legs broken in a
fall over the rocks. I killed the beast--I reckon
it was a puma--with some rocks, an&rsquo; lived on
the meat fer nigh on to a week. Then, after all kinds
o&rsquo; adventures in the mountains, I reached here,
an&rsquo; here I am, an&rsquo; so happy to see yeou
I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished tears stood in the honest eyes of the
Yankee lad, and Jack was no less affected. They embraced,
the native looking on in wonder, until the matter
was explained to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know this road like a book, so ye won&rsquo;t
need thet native no longer,&rdquo; said Plum. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;d like to have his nag. I&rsquo;m dead tired
o&rsquo; hoofin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have the pony--if he will sell,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got any money to pay with? I ain&rsquo;t got
a red cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had some funds with him, and soon a bargain was
closed with the native. Then the fellow went off,
leaving the former chums to themselves.</p>

<p>The supper Plum had been cooking was spoilt, but another
was presently prepared and both sat down to do justice
to the repast. As they ate each told his story in
detail, and Jack related his reason for coming back
to that portion of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to learn yeou made money on
them nitrates,&rdquo; said Plum. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I
am glad, too, thet you found yer gal true blue an&rsquo;
waitin&rsquo; for ye, Jack. But about this treasure
hunt,--well, I don&rsquo;t put much stock in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to solve the mystery of that boiling
lake, Plum. Even if I don&rsquo;t get the treasure
it will be something to learn what makes that water
shoot up as it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so, but don&rsquo;t yeou take
too many risks finding eout,&rdquo; returned the Yankee
lad.</p>

<p>Plum said he had expected to remain at the deserted
house all night and then push on for the seacoast.
But now he had met Jack, and had a pony at his service,
he was willing to go anywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no home nor nuthin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;One place is ez good ez another
to me,--only I like to be among friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay with me, Plum, and welcome,&rdquo; said
Jack, cordially. &ldquo;I can use you in my business,
if you want to come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am with yeou every time,&rdquo; said Plum,
and shook hands on it. As said before, he was without
funds and more than glad that our hero was willing
to assist him.</p>

<p>The night was spent at the dilapidated house without
anything unusual happening, and early in the morning
they got breakfast,--eating some birds Jack brought
down with his pistol--and then went on their journey.</p>

<p>Noon found them on the main road, and an hour later
they came across two of the members of Jack&rsquo;s
party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad to see you are alive,&rdquo;
said one of the men. &ldquo;We had about given you
up for lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came pretty near being lost forever,&rdquo;
answered Jack, and once again had to tell his story.
Then one of the men was despatched to bring up the
rest of the party; and by nightfall all hands were
together again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly be more careful in the future,&rdquo;
declared Jack. &ldquo;Such absent-mindedness does
not pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately some extra clothing had been brought along,
and a suit was given to Plum, for which he was exceedingly
thankful. That night Jack slept finely, and in the
morning declared himself in the best of health.</p>

<p>Once again the party moved forward to the rocky bowl
in the mountains holding the Devil&rsquo;s Waters.
By noon the summit of the ascent was gained and the
party came to a halt. Then Jack went ahead accompanied
only by Plum.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack reached a spot where he could look
into the vast bowl he saw that something unusual had
occurred. He was mystified and appalled and sat on
his pony spellbound.</p>

<p>The roar and thunder of the mysterious boiling lake
was gone. Not a sound broke the stillness of the mountainous
scene. He looked down on a grass-covered valley, somewhat
round, in size and having in its center a mound or
&ldquo;island,&rdquo; upon which grew a lonely pimento
tree. A branch of the tree, devoid of foliage, pointed
like a great finger, to a cut in the great mountain
bowl.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking such a landmark, and as Jack
viewed it he gave a long low whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Plum, questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am--am staggered, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look like a lake, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the last time I was here it was a boiling,
writhing lake, and that mound you see yonder was an
island in the middle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh all hemlock, Jack! Yeou don&rsquo;t mean
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assuredly do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a drop o&rsquo; water around
here neow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it and that is what puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t mistaken in the spot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Do you see that solitary pimento
tree? Well, that was there, exactly as it is now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeou said it would be, I remember that,&rdquo;
said Plum, scratching his head. &ldquo;But this ain&rsquo;t
no lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been. See, the grass shows signs of
having been covered with water mixed with mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so too, an&rsquo; neow I look at it,
Jack, ther&rsquo;s big holes in the ground here an&rsquo;
there, where the water must have run off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several minutes Jack and his friend surveyed the
scene. Then our hero urged his pony down the somewhat
steep side of the gigantic mountain bowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar be yeou a going now?&rdquo; asked Plum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the mound in the middle of the valley, to
see if I can find the treasure,&rdquo; shouted back
Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m with yeou,&rdquo; answered
the Yankee lad, and followed down the slope.</p>

<h1><a name="ch_29"></a>Chapter XXIX</h1>
<h2>The Treasure of the Boiling Lake</h2>

<p>It must be owned that Jack&rsquo;s heart beat rather
rapidly as he rode down into the little valley, hemmed
in on all sides by the high walls of the Andes mountains.</p>

<p>He remembered well what the paper had said concerning
the treasure, yet he did his best to steel himself
against possible disappointment.</p>

<p>Plum Deemed to read his thoughts, for as he rode up
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, thet treasure might have been here years
ago, but don&rsquo;t be disapp&rsquo;inted if it&rsquo;s
gone now. Them waters may have washed it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am willing to take what comes, Plum,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;But I want to know the exact
truth--I hate to be kept in suspense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll know afore long, I calkerlate,&rdquo;
returned the Yankee lad.</p>

<p>They had to pick their way with care to the &ldquo;island,&rdquo;
as Jack insisted upon calling it. The bed of the valley
was filled with holes and cuts, all of unknown depth.
Here and there the flat rocks were split in twain in
the most extraordinary fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been some great convulsion of nature
here,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Maybe the earthquakes
have something to do with the disappearance of the
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the water was here--an&rsquo; I believe
what you say--it must have gone down in &rsquo;em
holes and cuts,&rdquo; said Plum. &ldquo;But what made
it spout up ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some contraction of the hollows under the lake&rsquo;s
surface,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Maybe a cave
would get filled with water, then some rocks would
fill the cave up, causing the water to spout out into
the valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be thet--but it is certainly wonderful,
Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the pair reached the side of the mound or
&ldquo;island,&rdquo; Here they could gain a good
idea of the big pimento tree with its stricken branch
pointing to the distant hills. Around the pimento the
rocks were strewn in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was a cave here it is filled up,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity we didn&rsquo;t bring a spade along,&rdquo;
answered his companion.</p>

<p>Dismounting, they tied their ponies to the pimento
and then began to look around the mound, which was
several acres in extent. Rocks were cast up in all
directions, as if by the force of a volcano.</p>

<p>A half hour had passed, and they had found nothing
of value, when of a sudden Plum snatched up something
and gave a yell:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gold! gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; answered Jack, when he
had examined the piece. It was the size of his little
finger and similarly formed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The treasure must be here!&rdquo; went on the
Yankee lad. &ldquo;Come, let us look for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what we are doing already,&rdquo; answered
Jack, with something of a happy laugh. He, too, had
spotted something yellow between the rocks, and now
brought it forth, another piece of gold, twice the
size of Plum&rsquo;s find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for yeou!&rdquo; shouted the Yankee boy.
&ldquo;The rocks must be full o&rsquo; gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In feverish haste the search was continued, and soon
Jack had at least a pound of gold to his credit, while
Plum had nearly as much. Then, of a sudden, Jack stepped
on some loose dirt and shot out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! what yeou doing?&rdquo; yelled Plum, in
alarm, as he retreated from the hole that had appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me out!&rdquo; called up Jack. He had
gone down about a dozen feet, to bring up in a bed
of sand and small stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt any?&rdquo; queried Plum anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, Plum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any gold down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>He hunted around the opening and soon discovered a
passageway between two immense rocks. He lit a match
and one look around made his eyes open wildly.</p>

<p>Gold was there, on all sides of the passageway--enough
to make him rich for life!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plum, look here!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Gold--all
you want of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Du tell!&rdquo; roared the Yankee boy, and
without stopping to think twice he dropped down to
the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>Another match was lit, and then some dry brushwood,
and by the flickering light the two youths filled
their pockets with the precious metal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can load our ponies with gold,&rdquo; said
Jack. He was so delighted he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it--we&rsquo;ll carry away all
we can an&rsquo; then come back fer more,&rdquo; answered
the Yankee lad.</p>

<p>How to get to the top of the hole once more was a
problem, but at last Jack climbed on Plum&rsquo;s
shoulders. He was then able to grasp a tree root,
and by this means hauled himself upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do, Plum!&rdquo;
he called down. &ldquo;You throw up the gold to me
and I&rsquo;ll load it on the ponies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Jack. But don&rsquo;t forgit to
pay me fer the job,&rdquo; laughed Plum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay you? Why, Plum, a good share of this gold
is yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but yeou knew about the treasure, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. You can have a third anyway--and
I&rsquo;ll pay all expenses of this trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jack, yeou allers was a good feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that both boys worked away like Trojans for
the best part of an hour. The gold was there and Plum
flung up one piece after another, until the saddle
bags on both ponies were overflowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a load!&rdquo; cried Jack at
last. &ldquo;Any more down there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us take this to yonder hills and
hide it. Then we can come back for more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why to the hills, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because something tells me not to trust this
spot too long, Plum. Remember the boiling lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He assisted the Yankee lad to the top of the opening
and then, mounted on their ponies, they made their
way over the dry bottom of the lake to the rocky ridge
beyond. Here they deposited the gold in a safe place,
and then returned to the &ldquo;island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down this time,&rdquo; said Jack,
and did so. A torch had been brought along, and sticking
it in a crack of the rocks, the youth went to work
with a will.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the ponies were again loaded
with gold. Jack had picked up almost the last piece
in sight when he came to a sudden pause in his work.</p>

<p>What was that strange sound, and was it possible the
earth beneath him was trembling? He leaped back to
the center of the hole. Yes, the earth was surely
quaking, and now some loose dirt came down on top of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the earthquake!&rdquo; he murmured, and
at that moment came a loud cry from Plum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack! Jack! come up, as quick as yeou can!
The water is squirting up through &rsquo;em holes,
an&rsquo; the lake is filling up!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="ch_30"></a>Chapter XXX</h1>
<h2>A Ride for Life--Conclusion</h2>

<p>The earthquake was indeed upon them, and as Plum threw
down a rope to Jack the whole landscape seemed to
rock to and fro, causing the Yankee lad to miss his
footing and pitch headlong on our hero&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, did I hurt you?&rdquo; spluttered
Plum, as he stood upright at the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>Jack did not answer, for at that instant the earth
shook again, sending them both on their backs. Then
all became, for the instant, quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get away from this spot!&rdquo; gasped
Jack. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll be buried
alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rope had fallen at his feet. He picked it up.
There was a noose at one end and this he whirled upward.</p>

<p>Twice he missed the object for which he aimed, but
the third time the rope caught fast to a projecting
rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Plum, up you go!&rdquo; he said, and gave
his companion a lift. Fear lent the Yankee lad strength
and he went up hand over hand in rapid fashion. Jack
followed, and in a moment more both stood on the surface
of the island.</p>

<p>The sight that met their gaze was enough to make them
shudder. On all sides the darkish-green water was
spouting from the holes and cuts in the lake bed.
Some of the columns arose to a height of a hundred
feet, the water falling back into the basin with a
tremendous report, and causing the drops to fly in
all directions. At one point in the lake the water
was already a foot or more deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the shore!&rdquo; yelled Jack, and flew
for a pony, while Plum did likewise. The animals were
crazy with fear and could scarcely be controlled.</p>

<p>As they left the island there came another movement
of the earthquake, followed by a crash behind them.
They looked back, to see the lonely pimento tree fall
into the very hole they had just left!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh! what a narrer escape!&rdquo; gasped Plum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not out of it yet, Plum,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Come, we must ride for all we are worth.
Perhaps we had better throw away the gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; screamed
the Yankee lad. &ldquo;We can make the shore if we
hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down they plunged side by side from the island and
into the water that was now flowing in all directions
around the mound. They made a bee line for the rocky
ridge beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for holes!&rdquo; cried Jack, but
even as he spoke his pony plunged downward, nearly
causing our hero to take a header. But he clung fast,
and, struggling up, the pony went forward as before.</p>

<p>It was a ride that can scarcely be described. Soon
the water was up to the bodies of the ponies and then
they were carried off their feet. They swam a short
distance, and then, coming to a shallow spot, galloped
on as before.</p>

<p>It was a wild ride, and dripping from foam and water
the ponies kept on until once again they had to swim.</p>

<p>Then came a roar from the bottom of the lake, and
steeds and riders were hurled high in the air, to
fall again with a noise in the spume of the boiling
lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We--we air lost!&rdquo; panted Plum. &ldquo;Th--the
wind is gone out o&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on, we have only a short distance further
to go!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>

<p>The earth was shaking again and the water appeared
to swing away from them toward the island.</p>

<p>Then it came on with a rush, carrying ponies and riders
far up the rocky ridge. Then the water went back as
before, boiling and foaming furiously, while a mist
blotted out the immediate landscape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t stop here!&rdquo; yelled
Jack, urging his pony forward. &ldquo;To higher ground,
before it is too late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again they went on, but not for far. Another earthquake
threw them flat and Plum rolled down under his pony.
Then the quaking ceased; and that was the last of
the earthquake.  Arising, Jack helped his companion
and found that the Yankee youth was uninjured. Both
looked down the rocks toward the lake. The water was
boiling and foaming as before, but gradually the surface
of the lake grew calm. Then Jack gave another exclamation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The island! It is sinking from sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true, the island was going down slowly but
surely. In a few minutes it was but a mere speck on
the surface, and then even this disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; gasped Plum. &ldquo;But we got
the gold--or a good part o&rsquo; it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven that our lives were spared!&rdquo;
murmured Jack. &ldquo;I never want to go through another
such experience--not for all the gold in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<hr width="80%" size="1" />

<p>A few words more and we will bring our tale to a close.</p>

<p>When they had rested, Jack and Plum rejoined the others
of the party. The story of the hunt for gold was told,
much to the amazement of the rest, and, later, the
gold was taken down to the seacoast and placed with
some reliable bankers. The boiling lake was inspected
and found to be deeper than ever. Strange to say,
the lake remained where it was for about two months,
when it gradually disappeared, and that was the last
seen of it. The ground around where the pimento island
had been was greatly upheaved, and a long search in
that vicinity failed to bring any more gold to light.</p>

<p>The treasure that had been found proved to be worth
nearly thirty thousand dollars, one-third of which
went to Plum and the rest to Jack. Out of his share
our hero paid all the expenses of the trip and also
rewarded handsomely all those who had accompanied
him into the mountains.</p>

<p>With a portion of his money Jack continued to develop
his nitrate fields and shipped vast quantities of
the stuff to this country and elsewhere. He soon became
immensely wealthy, and then settled down with his wife,
Jenny, in Boston, where we will bid him farewell.</p>

<p>The End. </p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
